Room Service arrived at the time they estimated on the phone.. Have met many great staff here, all very accommodating and go beyond and above to help you.. The service was incredible.. Her positive  outburst of energy made for an unforgettable experience and while taking care of me she made sure other gusts were being helped as well, Lilia is a true star engaging hospitality, making us feel welcome creating that emotional connection that will bring me back to1hotel even if just for another cup of coffee and a pastry and a first class experience when I‚Äôm back in town on another short trip, possibly to experience the Hotel as well.. We love the 1, especially the beach service.. Jake on the beach took care of all of our needs and was quick and friendly.. The food and drinks are top notch at both beach and pool, and towel/chair service is fast and efficient.. Not only is the hotel beautiful with amazing amenities, but the staff goes above and beyond..

Her energy is really contagious in addition to the professionalism in the service.. The hotel is perfect, exceptional service !!!!.

The service was professional, friendly, and quick.. We could not be any happier with service and food.. Even though the hotel was packed (since it was spring break), nothing felt overcrowded and the staff was very attentive.. Burak and his staff were exceptional and it was one of the best experiences I've had in Miami.. Great bartenders and staff at 1

AxelBeach Miami,"AxelBeach Miami is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 1500 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139-3111. This hotel offers a range from $137 - $227 per night and is ranked #41 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 160 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include:  The staff was very friendly.. The room was fine - clean and well equipped - and there were plenty of relatively friendly staff around.. There is a small drop-off area for guests to leave their cars when they check-in, but some of the staff is allowed to park there.. There is a large public parking garage (for a fee) just a block away, and I think they should pay for their staff to park there.. Very kind service.. The staff was rude and unhelpful.. Unfortunately these are outweighed by the negatives including poorly trained reception desk staff who act like they are doing you a favour when you approach to ask a question and an even worse manager, who is rarely in the hotel when you ask for him.. For the length of time we were staying at the hotel we thought we would be priority guests but that didn't matter at all to the reception staff who were rude, dismissive and unaccomodating.. The staff are brilliant especially the bar staff.. I have always felt at home when I am in Miami, but the staff at the front desk (Delfina and Joaquin) has taken it to the next level.. Axel management has definitely taken customer service a serious matter as I have stayed at Axel Barcelona (first time 15 years ago), Axel Buenos Aires and Axel Berlin, with all consistent customer service.. Stayed at the Axel in Barcelona and Miami Beach a few times, and it‚Äôs always provided top notch service.. Service was great - friendly staff and overall a good stay .. We really enjoyed our stay at Axel Beach the staff are super friendly everything was neat and clean and you get two sun beds on the beach üòçthe location is perfect walking distance to the main streets!. Appreciate the service!. Staff is Amazing, my wife and I were greeted with pleasant smiles and helpful hands.. We were accommodated with ease and was able to check in earlier than our call time which was super helpful and kind.. The staff are lovely and will go above and beyond to help.. Staff was amazingly helpful, everyone has a smile, and they catered to my requests.. We needed and the staff were beyond amazing.. Thank you John especially for amazing service.. The bar staff were amazing as well!. Danas was very helpful and professional.. got in 4 hours early and Danas got us in early, great service all around.. Clean, good sheets and towels and friendly staff.. Poor reception customer service, they just didn‚Äôt seem bothered apart from Esme who was lovely.. Basic and dated room (and it wasn‚Äôt the standard room); I asked for a firm pillow and was told they didn‚Äôt have, until I asked to speak with the manager, then all of a sudden a firm pillow arrived ‚Äòreluctantly‚Ä?by housekeeping staff; Breakfast average, often just luke warm, although the bar staff were nice.. The staff was very friendly and made sure we had a great time.. Rodrigo at the front desk was very helpful.. The staff overall was very warm and friendly.. The days that the two of them do not have a shift is quite noticeable because the quality of customer service drops.. All the staff is really friendly and helpful.. The hotel stuff were really nice, kind and helpful.. Rodrigo, the hotel host was really helpful and kind.. He was also super helpful with questions we had about the city during our stay.. Axel was amazing and the hotel staff was amazing , would definitely return and think it is great value for money and location so a huge thank you to all of you there !. These two guys where so helpful, understanding and accomodating.. Staff were caring and happy.. Hotel staff was amazing.. Excellent customer service from reception team especially John.. All front desk staff are always smiling and making your day starting very good.. Ahmad was very nice and helpful.. We arrived early, and the hotel staff was immediately so welcoming.. The service of Daniel, Javier, and Franco was like no other, and I‚Äôm most definitely staying here the next time I‚Äôm in South Beach!

Berkeley Shore Hotel,"Berkeley Shore Hotel is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 1610 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139-3113. This hotel offers a range from $158 - $294 per night and is ranked #40 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 96 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: We also had a pool and ocean view.. Rooms were clean, rooftop pool had great views of the high rises, hotel restaurant food was delicious and service was excellent.. I had family stay before and they had overall good reviews.. After reading several reviews of this hotel, we didn‚Äôt have any unexpected surprises.. Our room was the Premium room with partial ocean view and balcony on the 10th floor.. Since this is not an ocean front location, I was not surprised that it was more of a glimpse vs. ocean view.. Standard rooms are either on lower  floors or without any view (alley) or looking inside another hotels window.. Keep in mind ""partial ocean"" view is not because of the beam, but because of the other hotels in front of it blocking the view.. Rooms 703, 704 (numbered 1, 4 on attached pic) are partial view but have a beam right in a middle of your balcony which ruins it and not what is advertised when they charge you double the price.. Rooms 701, and 702 (numbered 2,3 on pic attached) are in a middle and are the ONLY 2 rooms on each high floor  that still have partial view of the  ocean because of the hotel location BUT they are without the blocking beam, which is exactly what is advertised online, and they are the same exact price as the ones with blocking hotel beam.. In reading the previous reviews before I chose this hotel I was a bit nervous because some of them were really bad.. We opted for the premier Plus room with balcony overlooking the pool and partial ocean view.. It is my observation that if you stay on the 4th floor or higher that you might have the better experience, and maybe this is where the negative reviews come from.. The location is unbeatable, so near to the beach, we had ocean view from our room!!!. Our ocean view was magnificent!. So they put is another room which was ‚Äúdiscounted‚Ä?- no it was a crap room with a broken a/c and city view (the alley).. After one night We asked them to move us to a room (balcony with beach view) more equivalent to our original booking which they did but with one bed instead of two.. The photos and the inflated reviews were not representative.. Service in breakfast really really good, average price great 
Parcial ocean view and private beach.. Our room was lovely - 10th floor balcony with a partial ocean view.. The room included a balcony that overlooked the pool with amazing views of the skyline.. We relaxed on the rooftop pool and enjoyed the views. The staff were very friendly.. The pool is very nice but limited loungers, the beach was a short walk away which was very nice, the resort fee covered lounge chair, umbrella and there was also bar service.. The staff was kind and welcoming, the room was clean and spacious, and the bed was comfortable.. I would recommend getting the breakfast included option as the breakfast was delicious, and the service was quick and professional.. Staff was great!. Rooms were clean, rooftop pool had great views of the high rises, hotel restaurant food was delicious and service was excellent.. The room is great, the staff amazing, you have a pool on the roof and a very nice terrase in front of the hotel.. The staff were amazingly friendly!. The staff was pleasant.. Great staff also!. It was very clean and the staff was great.. The gym and pool are terrible with no staff or service.. It seems a valet service that takes care of 7 other hotels is whom they use.. Nice hotel, clean and 'most' of the staff are friendly and professional.. Great location, beautiful art deco hotel in the middle of everything; comfy beds, great toiletries, and super attentive staff.. We were greeted each day with a smile and also nice compliments from one of the staff, Robert.. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about activities.. The staff was friendly and helpful in giving us restaurant recommendations.. The best part of my Iberostar cancun experience was the great service Jordan gave us!. He did a beautiful job decorating and organizing our room and He was very kind, responsive and helpful.. Jordan offered me the best hotel service i needed when traveling to cancun for my birthday.. In comparasion to other iberostar resorts cleaning service, the best and the highlight of them have been jordan!. Our room was coming out to the pool and collins ave and eveb though there was a clear noise at night, the sliding doors took care of it, and we slept good.. The staff was pleasant, but quite a few did not speak English (housekeeping).. Ceasar was a great example of hospitality and always with a smile and genuine willingness to help.. Food and beverage service on the beach (from Loews) is good, although a bit pricey and the servers were stretched a little thin due to lots of orders.. -only one staff member at check-in desk at any given time due to this not being a huge hotel.. However, the staff were very courteous and helpful.. One criticism would be when calling for room service we‚Äôd have to collect it from the restaurant - not exactly room service. The staff is great, they were very helpful and very nice every time we needed something!!!. Excellent service, spacious and comfortable rooms and perfect location only 2 blocks away from the beach and in the heart of Collins Ave.. This hotel is a gem in South Beach, with amazing location and wonderful friendly staff.. They charge a fee for beach services, as most of the hotels in the area, but it is totally worth it!. Staff very friendly and accommodating!. Rooms are ok, Only showers are a little weird‚Ä?Filia Restaurant is very good, excellent food and Service.. Location great, staff really great but a bit overwhelmed, beach lounge access free - excellent plus, valet parking although with a daily fee was a plus.. Staff very friendly.. Room service
didn't provide any towels, so we had to use our towel from
day 1.. Our room was located at the second floor face to
entrance of the hotel, from 8am in the morning they played
music loudly, so we had to woke up every day with hotel
staff because of their noise.. the rooms are very tidy and clean, and the staff is super friendly.. Service in breakfast really really good, average price great 
Parcial ocean view and private beach.. Staff needs proper training.. They don't know proper guest service especially room service.. We were impressed with how clean the hotel was and how helpful and attentive the staff was.. There is room service, but we did not use it.. The front desk staff was very helpful and arranged for a taxi to Hard Rock Stadium for us.. All the wait staff were friendly and accommodating.. The staff were friendly and courteous.. It is a very comfortable hotel, it has valet parking, the rooms are very good and clean, the breakfast is delicious and they have beach service which is great.. Everyone who works here is very kind and helpful. For more information, visit http://www.berkeleyshore.com or check reviews online to learn more about guest experiences."

The view from the patio is awesome.. (Read my last review for how our last experience was.). Great view of the ocean.. The view was awesome since it was too cool to be outside.. We didn't have the ocean view, but we had TONS of space.. Paid for an king oceanfront room, given a double ocean view room and not given a refund or a discount for a less expensive room.. I was scared because of the reviews but honestly it was amazing!!. We had the partial ocean view room.. Depending on your room preference, there are rooms with an ocean view.. Nice partial view of the ocean and good service at the on-site restaurant.. Excellent location, great service, good view to the ocean.. Restaurant is very good, nice ambience and delicious food
Staff is friendly and courteous
Great location
Amazing ocean view from room 
Direct exit to the beach Pool closes too early, our oceanview room had a view if you hang off the porch w/camera,  Elevators took a long time, front desk staff advised us not to eat at in house cafe...Smallest bathroom & no counter space.. Staff were helpful.. Thanks to Tony the night Manager, he is very professional and did take care of us.. The concierge, Eduardo is super friendly and helpful.. Very poor service from the minute we checked in.. Between the lackluster customer service and responsiveness, you get what you pay for.. Fantastic staff!. Great location and staff.. It took a consultation with the entire staff to finally give me one free night out of our three-night stay.. I was upset that I had to spend at least 20 minutes arguing with the staff, and it ruined the beginning of my vacation.. Rating of Staff: 2/5 for lack of competence.. Be careful when leaving the property for the beach!. Staff was very helpful, room was very clean, everything was perfect.. This hotel has unfriendly and unknowledgeable front desk staff.. Staff is so helpful.. The staff try‚Äôs their best to accommodate each and every guest.. Good working people and good work and people very nice and helpful.. The staff was rude.. Also as expected be prepared to use google translate most of the staff can‚Äôt speak English ( which is fine because of the location ) but definitely worsened the experience of this stay Very indicated by the customer service of this hotel I planned my vacations in advance and made my reservation when I arrived they had canceled my reservation and they made me wait 3 hours to be able to give me a room being their fault for having canceled my reservation I asked to speak with a manager but none was available the front desk they are all mediocre they do not know what they are doing one says one thing and the other employee says something else they do not agree on how they should treat a client and more surprised that this happens in miami beach where there is all the tourism ,I would definitely never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone as we travel from so far away and plan our vacations well in advance.. The staff especially Muhammed at the front were great!. Friendly staff.. The staff was so welcoming.. The staff is friendly.. Restaurant has limited hours of service.. This is our third time staying at this beautiful hotel .we love the beautiful rooms,  the staff is amazing, great food in the restaurant and the new coffee shop in the hotel üè® with a pool table.. I showed him my copy of the reservation confirmation that I received from Best Western, and the staff managed to fix my reservation on their end.. The people in the hotel, were very friendly, helpful, and courteous.. One very important detail is to be careful when you walk through the gate to the beach.. I had to stand on a chair to take out battery after a 30 minute runaround when no staff was available to do the work.. The restaurant was conveniently located, the staff was professional and friendly, and room was comfortable and clean.. I enjoyed the beach area behind the hotel, the bar staff at pool side was friendly and made a nice drink.. Jefferson Romulo and Nidia was also very calm staff and nice.. I was scared because of the reviews but honestly it was amazing!!. Front desk was super helpful with questions about transportation, food, etc.. It was a pleasant stay , the front desk staff was super helpful , the rooms was clean and in general everything look fantastic , I will recommended this hotel ,the pool was warm and the beach was perfect. Excellent visit - amenities and property are well-maintained; the hotel staff provided excellent  customer service.. Beach, internet, bar, restaurant, gym and a super friendly staff always willing to help customers to have a great experience.. But you still expect good service and care for your needs.. The staff was very rude and condescending.. Giving us attitude.Super lazy staff.. Nice partial view of the ocean and good service at the on-site restaurant.. Excellent location, great service, good view to the ocean.. The staff are amazing, they treated us very well making sure we were happy and satisfied.. Rooms did not get below 73 degrees, front desk staff was not friendly, any issues we had, they acted as if we were an inconvenience to them.. If you want to use the laundry services, bring your own quarters as 5th will send you across her street to a CVS pharmacy.. Hotel staff was very helpful.. Had to rekey my room several times but the hotel staff rekeying my card, didn‚Äôt seem to bother them.. Everything is hospital clean, nice restaurant, nice staff..

He goes and grabs for drinks for the rest of his staff to drink.. Horrible place and even worse staff, don't waste your time or money going here unless you have other options even then you're better off sleeping on a bench.. The staff was above and beyond friendly.. JJ was also more than helpful suggesting places to visit to make my vacation more exciting..

Carillon Miami Wellness Resort,"Carillon Miami Wellness Resort is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 6801 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33141-3243. This hotel offers a range from $382 - $769 per night and is ranked #34 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 150 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: I am giving this review because I adore this wellness resort and they are best in class to provide fitness instructors.. My breakfast was possibly the saddest breakfast I've eaten of all the breakfasts I'd had - and I will say this was absolutely our mistake for not reading the reviews and feedback about the restaurant.. I do not understand these reviews.. The view and beach are perfect, with water to drink everywhere!. The views, the gym, the rooms, the spa and the beach.. So no outdoor eating with a view. For some reason, I just got used to the fact that in hotels where you pay a thousand dollars per night, the service is of a completely different level.. Although it is possible that America has become just a very expensive country, and the pandemic has completely destroyed the local service.. Next time I will definitely stay at the Ritz on Miami Beach - what if I'm wrong, and chain hotels still maintain a normal level of service.. But it apperently lacks the basic level of service of a five-star hotel.. The front desk clerks were very friendly and helpful.. Management has taken to stationing a bodyguard outside their offices...obviously staff morale is in the pits.. The service I received from the the booking process to my departure was fantastic!. My services began at 11:30 and ended at 5pm.. Staff are very nice and helpful and guide you through the process.. The staff are really unmatched in their kindness and hospitality and make for an excellent stay.. The spa is the highlight with so many innovative ways to relax and they take such good care of you.. They were very helpful and very kind and are an asset to the hotel.. The service people for the most part were wonderful- especially the bellhop Chris!. Check in was quick and the staff was friendly and helpful.. They continually acted like we were a nuisance and asking for something unreasonable when we made it clear we didn't care where our new room was or what it was or if it was facing an alley - we just wanted to be able to plug things in without the lights going out.. I will say the staff was always incredible nice and apologetic, it just seemed like they could never manage this rush.. The spa and wellness and fitness services were the absolute highlight of the experience.. We were delighted thinking we could grab these the head down, but the staff member told us we couldn't remove them from the area and the downstairs pool should be set up (news flash it was not - since we just came from here).. We saw a staff member setting chairs up and asked if we could also get set up and he said he had just grabbed these from the pool since someone asked him and the beach wasn't set up.. After some beach time we asked if we could extend our check out even by 15 or 30 minutes so we could have just a little bit of extra time to get cleaned up and explained we totally understood if they couldn't do it and then had the most patronizing experience with front desk staff telling us it was super tight and it would be really really hard to do and a burden but maybe they could make it work.. Service overall not comparable to other 5 star hotels, but hotel was great for our purposes with family.. They have service on the beach which was fine but drinks/food was very slow.. The Staff was terrific, very professional while respecting our desire for some much needed downtime.. Our time was unstructured and self directed, with the staff available and knowledgeable to add suggestions for our fun itinerary was packed with alternatives for our body and mind  recharge.. The Concierge Staff also seemed to personally know, and have access to, the best tables at  every exceptional restaurant option up and down the Miami Beaches.. The staff throughout was friendly and helpful.. The management and entire staff was so professional, friendly and accommodating ‚Ä?they assisted us with changing our room to a two-bedroom ocean front suite with a terrace.. The entire staff was extremely helpful with everything we needed.. The service experience was great with some highlights.. Ilya and Tayfun at the front desk/reception were very helpful and attentive in talking care of our needs to help make our stay as smooth and easy as possible.. Alex Carnot on the Front Desk was very helpful with information about the property, rooms, etc.. Issues invariably come up during most hotel stays and the Carillon staff were quick and happy to address and solve them.. Felix and the staff we interacted with were a pleasure to deal with.. Would recommend the Carillon if you‚Äôre looking for an active, wellness-oriented stay at a property with great service in a location on a wide beautiful stretch of beach in Miami Beach.. I look forward to coming back soon and want to thank Tammy and her entire staff for such a life changing Five Star experience!. With the prices of this place you‚Äôd expect quality customer service, she doesn‚Äôt seem very well trained for her position.. He is amazing - very helpful and personable.. Many thanks to Alex and his team for their superb hospitality and customer service.. The housekeeping staff was also responsive and Sonnia, Spa front desk reception was fantastic.. I have documentation, etc, but the hotel does not care.. This despite it being overpriced, understaffed with mediocre food, unusable WiFi (forget streaming), cheap uncomfortable beds and furniture, poorly equipped kitchens.. Housekeeping staff stole my jewelry‚Ä¶unprofessional management.. He didn‚Äôt care‚Ä?he never communicated with me about it.. Rooms were very nice and very comfortable, service was amazing.. Hotel staff are awesome and very professional.. The beach  was just great.. server on the beach great job of taking care of us... The staff was extremely helpful and professional.. Pool/ Beach excellent service and experience.. My wife and I used the spa services, many of which are included in your stay.. He stayed after it was time for him to leave to make sure that we were taken care of.

The manager was so unfriendly, it‚Äôs like he went out of his way to be rude and as unhelpful as possible.. When we finally got checked in, hadn‚Äôt been in room no time, a member of staff pecked on the door and immediately opened the door and came in.. Good points at The Catalina Hotel and (not) beach club are that the bar staff seemed polite and efficient.. Then the breakfast - waited 40 minutes for initial service.. Hotel staff were very helpful and a special shout out to Livia and Cindy at reception for going above and beyond.. Thank you Juan, Nicholas, and Diego, for all your kind service.. As a matter of fact, I was quite surprised at the level of service and amount of amenities, this hotel had to offer.. Obren, the manager took good care of us and Dian, our server was great!. So basically, while great location, nothing that a little staff training and hoover couldn't sort..... The whole staff was always available and nice to us.. Cindy and Livia were so helpful..

This hotel offers a range from $191 - $350 per night and is ranked #101 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 46 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: Very clean and the bed was comfortable, we were up on the third floor facing the ocean which was a great view.. The views and the staff are amazing.. We would have loved a sea view room but these are limited, if we had paid more I'm sure a sea view would have been no issue.. The views from the room were horrible. It is a boutique style hotel with wonderfully quirky decor and very friendly and efficient service.. The hotel staff were extremely attentive to our requests and helpful with suggestions and tips about activities and excursions.. Reception was very nice nice and helpful.. Breakfast was slow service, but it was busy, and the food was good.. Check in staff was great but wait staff could be nicer.. Window towards Ocean Drive 

Great breakfast service with a lot of choices on freshly prepared breakfast.. I have been impressed with their level of customer service and everything that they offer here.. Personnel was very nice, especially the young man who checked me in and again checked me out a couple of days later (didn't get his name but he was nice, helpful, and friendly).. Very friendly staff, amazing service and so much history at the hotel!!. The views and the staff are amazing.. Staff was very polite and housekeeping superb.. The hotel is 1930s in style and this must be taken into consideration, if you are expecting a modern 5* hotel, you will be disappointed, this hotel offers a 5* service and is very clean with spacious rooms.. I was scared to enter and called the front desk right away.. I double check each time I leave the room that the door is tightly shut so I knew someone or  the staff were in my room, doing what I don't know.. Eddie at the front desk is super helpful and helps with accommodations.. Most of the staff are very friendly & co-operative.. I had also used the parking valet service and the 37.50 fee was taken from my card without being asked if this was the way I wanted to pay for it.. Great restaurant and awesome service.. The manager, Eddie was really nice and helpful, I would definitely be back again soon.. Hotel is very well located right in front of the beach and the staff is really good. The staff are very welcoming and calm.. I stayed here for one night - the staff were friendly from check in, all the way to helping until I left the hotel.. Breakfast cooked is fresh with great service.. Staff was also nice.. Staff was fabulous, especially Philip at the front desk.. The room was spacious and super clean 
Staff friendly especially Nesrine at the reception that helped me with another booking and was just super super friendly with all my questions 
I had dinner at the hotels restaurant on the bustling street - what a vibe.. Food was good value for money delicious and the staff also super friendly 
I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel üèÜ. Staff was friendly.. Service like that is hard to beat!!. Room service, although it is offered, is not available.. The restaurant is serviceable.. Great service!. The rooms are rather classical, the location is close to anything you need, the staff is absolutely friendly and help you with their kind attitude.. We said we would like the manager to take a look at our situation in that case, and the front desk person then told me to email the manager for faster service.. I did hear a staff member knock on doors to ask for quiet, but the fighting continued later.. Only came for a night and even though it was very in and out, I didn‚Äôt find it to be the best service, I did expect a little more than what I received but I guess that is becuase I needed to spend more time there.

Clinton Hotel South Beach,"Clinton Hotel South Beach is a hotel rated 3.5 stars, located at 825 Washington Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33139-5802. This hotel offers a range from $116 - $233 per night and is ranked #151 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 88 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: The extra charges were a bit of a pain and wish I'd have known about it beforehand, perhaps I should have read the other reviews on here!. I'd stay here again but will get a street view room for sure.. Our room faced an alley of dumpsters and the windows were frosted over to block the view.. If the hotel staff had the work ethic and commitment to service and satisfaction that the Limonada staff had, I would not be writing this review.. All negative reviews are true.. Having read some of the reviews, I was a little nervous before arriving.. This is what really inspired my average review even despite roaches.. After reading so many negative reviews I was worried about what to expect, but we had a great 3 night stay here after a weeks‚Ä?cruise.. We were allocated a superior city view room which had 2 double beds, decent wardrobe space and a modern shower room.. I did upgrade to the king room on a higher floor and did not have any issues with sound from other rooms as has been posted in other reviews.. My  main reason tp write a review is to shame the management of this hotel for their dishonesty in advertising and let them know that without their excellent staff they would have nothing.. I typically do not write too many reviews and when I do, they are good ones.. However, I thought it was very important that I write this review on how disappointing this hotel was. Hotel reception staff were friendly and pretty relaxed.. Staff were kind though and location was great too.. The staff were pleasant and have some good tourist advice as well as arranging our transfer when we departed. Overnight staff told us we couldnt use the public restroom as they close this during the overnight period.. Unfortunately the service level has changed due to new owners.. Front desk service is lacking.. We were so disappointed in how the staff have handled the complaint of the room, and finally the cockroaches crawling on the nightstand.. I do want to give credit to the pool area, DJ and the staff at Limonada!. If the hotel staff had the work ethic and commitment to service and satisfaction that the Limonada staff had, I would not be writing this review.. We were so impressed with the cleanliness and the friendly staff.. Barely friendly and unwelcoming staff.. I must say, I was surprised with the wonderful hospitality we received.. The hotel staff was able to accommodate our early arrival for our first night and we were upgraded to a suite for our second and third nights.. The staff was indifferent to the complaints and acted normally.. It obviously looked so different online but staff was great, always asked if I needed anything.. Also We didn‚Äôt have a problem with staff everyone was super friendly and accommodating.. The reception area is pleasant enough and the staff were ok (they were a little blunt but we found a lot of people on Miami Beach to be like that).. When it was time to check out staff was very unprofessional.. The lobby, restaurant, pool and staff was great.. Instead of the owner(s) spend some of all that money they‚Äôre making to make the rooms clean and mold free, they rather paint over the mold and don‚Äôt care about your health at all!. The front office staff is very hostile and not friendly at all.. Friendly welcoming reception and Porter staff.. Went to Limonada the adjoining bar/restaurant, and again, very friendly staff including the lovely manager who took time to chat to us while we sat by the pool area.. Christian on beech very helpful, sorted towels & beds & local info.. The staff member, Anthony was very patient and kind with each guest.. We returned to the front desk and encountered the same kind and friendly staff member who quickly accommodated our request for an indoor room and extra towels (in case the ones in the room were also stained.). Overall, the customer service was good but the property left something to be desired.. It would have been totally miserable experience except for the fact that there are some extraordinary staff members who try their hardest and are so nice it was hard for me to get too mad.. Wish I knew all the  names at Limonada, they took good care of us, we hosted a family gathering in pool area patio,  Now that is another issue I have to mention--  somehow we are shared a ""resort fee"" for what is essentially a restaurant space.. My  main reason tp write a review is to shame the management of this hotel for their dishonesty in advertising and let them know that without their excellent staff they would have nothing.. The staff was very friendly and helpuf!!!. Front desk is staffed with people who lack hospitality skills.. Jeremy in particular was extremely unhelpful and would cut me off or talk over me every time I tried to explain a concern I had.. The TV in our room didn‚Äôt work, the food in the restaurant lacked flavor and the service was subpar.. The staff was great, a special mention to Josie who is just a careful and amazing person!. My children and I were greeted well by the front staff and the lobby is small and boutique style.. Not sure we would be back but just know they do clean them well but I thought it would be better cared for.. I tried to work with the staff for a refund and be on my way but it is best the public knows as I wish my friends and I did so we could have made suggestions to friend's hubby before booking!

Dream South Beach,"Dream South Beach is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 1111 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33139-4604. This hotel offers a range from $169 - $287 per night and is ranked #22 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 107 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: Cons: didn‚Äôt love the view out our window (of busy collins ave) but not really the hotel‚Äôs fault.. However, researching hotels with good reviews and no noise complaints should have led to a decent stay and it did not.. On reflection, there are a large number of positive 5* reviews for this hotel which are written by ""users"" who never wrote a review before or after the ones completed for Dream South Beach.. Users who do not have a genuine photo (vague landscape pics typically), name drop specific staff, the same ones mentioned over and over.. You may note, the reviews written by genuine, regular users do not routinely name drop in the way.. I went on dream south Beach during the day, but i really recomend to Go on the sunset, the view must be awesome.. The views , cocktails, staff - everything was just perfect! Their exceptional service and friendly attitudes truly made my time at the Dream hotel one to remember.. Fabulous roof top pool with amazing service.. Took care of us and made sure we had the perfect seats by the pool.. The staff are amazing and do well to distract from the hotel‚Äôs failings.. The ladies who waited the tables for the bar/restaurant were always so helpful and friendly so the juxtaposition was jarring.. Justin at the rooftop pool provided us world class service and even gave us helpful information to navigate South Beach.. I enjoyed the bar and service at the pool.. The staff was wearing see-through clothing, rude on phones texting and very unprofessional.. The staff always had a smile on their face and were happy to assist any way they could.. The staff was friendly and the location excellent but that is IRRELEVANT when the room is falling apart.. Arrived late in evening on Fri 30th Jan and started out okay, staff were friendly and we were quickly checked in.. Thought we may finally get some sleep then, even with the painful bed but at 5am, banging started in the bar below again as the staff started arriving for the breakfast service - in no way were they quiet, lots of banging and crashing!!. To add insult to injury, one of the staff wandered out of the afore mentioned double doors and had a long, loud conversation on her phone - walking up and down outside the room.. Users who do not have a genuine photo (vague landscape pics typically), name drop specific staff, the same ones mentioned over and over.. Justin was so helpful when checking us into the area and assured his safety and we‚Äôll gesture.. They have oka pool, good foods and drinks.Our waitress was sweet and helpful.. It is a solid 3-star hotel with a super friendly staff.. We wanted to move out and contacted the hotel manager but he could not care less, they had our money and they just half laughingly said that ""you already got the quietest room"".. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful and amicable!. The care they gave - felt like home.. The views , cocktails, staff - everything was just perfect!. We loved our roof top experience at Dreams south beachüíúthe hotel is clean, the staff is amazing and the overall vibe is perfect for a South Beach afternoon experience while being close to the beach!. Friendly, helpful, and quick to accommodate our needs with a genuine smile.. The entire staff was kind, polite and eager to please.. What I loved : 
The property is awesome, as is the staff and everything about it (especially after seeing the hotels there are in Miami Beach).. Only positive points:
1- The staff: incredibly nice!. 2- design, cleanliness and room: hotel which takes care of the detail and which is decorated with taste.. 4- Services: swimming pool in the rooftop with bar, free deckchairs on the beach with towels (beach at 6 minutes walk).. Did not like - just a few small remarks but nothing mean:
1- the door of the toilet (separate shower and toilet with the sink) which does not close well and a bit transparent (I know it goes with the beautiful design of the room but personally I prefer completely closed bathroom doors)
2- no breakfast possible at the hotel (with this service it would be really perfect). The pool was amazing and the young man who helped me Noah Whyte, was the sweetest and very helpful.. Stayed here for 5 days had a great time rooftop patio is fantastic, great service from Justin!. Best rooftop pool in town, and importantly, friendliest and most helpful staff.. The High Bar / pool is unmatched because of the service.. The staff was so kind, special mention to Joaquin who made the stay more pleasant by answering all our doubts.. Justin was really helpful and accommodating.. Justin was a great server and so helpful to us for any and all of our needs!. The service was great, especially Joaquin, who was always there if we need something.. Thank to the staff, commodities and the guys in the front desk, who were super lovely.. Great drinks, amazing nachos and tacos, and Justin took great care of us.. We really loved the service level.. Guys from staff are super cool and helpful.. The staff was very helpful and polite in every way.. Room service was great, bringing us ice whenever we needed it, and delivering delicious frozen drinks upon request.. They also have a very easy to use service for towels and chairs right in the beach.. Staff are great, friendly and fun, room was good, bed very comfy, would have liked coffee making facilities, location is great, pool on the roof is great, difficult to fault to be honest apart from how expensive it is, $9 for a small bottle of beer!. Justin was a very welcoming employee , he gave us insights on nice places in Miami and also took great care to expectations to the hotel visit.. I stayed at the dream hotel for a few nights and really had a blast and enjoyed my stay the front desk was so friendly Omarion was really great and helpful I look forward to visiting again thanks again. He just gave us the feeling that we were on vacations, very helpful always with a big smile, so nice!

Faena Miami Beach,"Faena Miami Beach is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 3201 Collins Ave Faena District, Miami Beach, FL 33140-4023. This hotel offers a range from $729 - $1,426 per night and is ranked #5 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 179 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: I have to create time to come write this review.. It would be a 3 star review if it were a 4 star $500 a night type place.. We booked a junior king suite partial ocean view room for $1600/night.. The room felt like 4 star vegas with no view.. 2) the hotel is right next to another taller / bigger building that is pretty close, so 95% of the view was blocked/looking directly at that building.. All have better views/pool, and the One and Standard are notably better locations (especially the standard; One is closer / more walkable.. I think Faena gets the strong reviews more from the service (which is great and which does make people want to reciprocate with a good review) and the restaurants (they are cool but you dont need to stay here to eat here).. But actual rooms, views, location all mediocre, pool etc.. But after the superlative reviews and at a rather breathtaking price, I honestly was expecting something perfect.. The minuses: my room (415) was billed as an ocean view junior suite.. However, the ocean view from such a low floor isn‚Äôt much - and the room, right on top of the spa, looks much more directly onto an events/dining area - sitting on the balcony didn‚Äôt feel private or restful at all.. I booked a premium ocean view room by phone with the help of Raul Diaz.. That‚Äôs the only positive of this review.. Because after the pool fiasco, we up and left the Faena for greener pastures ‚Ä?the reliable Four Seasons in the Brickell section of Miami, which was wonderful (see my review of that wonderful hotel for details).. My days here are always perfect, the staff , food ,views, room are all amazing.. I love Waking up to that beautiful ocean view, then going downstairs to have our breakfast and spend the day at the beautiful pool and beach  keep up the great work!. Our room, a one bedroom junior partial view suite was gorgeously appointed. Petar in particular always ensures that my stay is wonderful every time and gives me total peace of mind every time I stay there - I never have to worry about a thing and he goes above and beyond to provide excellent service.. Their staff is magnificent and know how to care for your every whim.. The service was top tier.. He was just so helpful and kind !. He just did an amazing Service !. everyone was very helpful and professional.. To start with the positive: The services is really good/attentive, the grounds (not rooms) and restaurants are cool/flashy/sceney, and the pool/grounds are solid (not the best in miami).. It is popular for the restaurants and cool designs on the grounds and well trained staff.. However overall I think there are much better luxury options in miami beach / south beach for an actual stay, if you care more about quality of rooms/actual property, location, and pool.. I think Faena gets the strong reviews more from the service (which is great and which does make people want to reciprocate with a good review) and the restaurants (they are cool but you dont need to stay here to eat here).. The service at the Faena is exceptional.. We have been to Miami before but this stay was the best, the staff was incredible.. The pluses: the staff, the staff, the staff.. Kind and genuinely wanting to be helpful.. Not a big deal but not perfect service either.. Food and beverage; dinner at Los Fuegos and breakfast were great service.. The pool and beach food service is great but the food not that exciting.. I will probably come back because of the service.. Me and my best friend came to the faena hotel for our one year friend anniversary and it did not disappoint thanks to our amazing service from Dana.. Our server Karelia, take care of us and give us recommendations about food and drinks.. The show was amazing and the staff accommodating.. Food and service was amazing.Im not a drinker but my server nicole recommended a drink called smoke sparks and i ended up having like 3 .. Gave us good recommendations , friendly and perfect customer service!. Amazing hotel, staff, food and service.. Raul Diaz a Reservation's Specialist was so kind and caring, took the time to coordinate every details with me and in a carefully detailed email outlined everything that we had discussed.. He was helpful and you could really tell he cared about your stay.. We were really impressed with the service especially Raul in reservations who was super helpful in setting us up with the perfect room!. was really knowledgeable about the different meats extremely helpful and super delicious.. Sofia D. from in-house reservations was extremely kind and helpful when making the reservation.. Raul was so helpful and set us up with a beautiful room, including cake, wine and handwritten note!. We ate a fabulous dinner at Los Fuegos and the next morning had room-service breakfast overlooking the ocean, enjoyed the pool and relaxed at the spa before packing up.. They have a fantastic staff from right when you walk in the door, that have such excellent manners and energy!!. Staff was friendly, beach nice, room spacious and clean.. Food and service is excellent, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the location on Miami Beach is perfect.. I help run an uber-lux hotel in Upstate, NY (The Maker Hotel) and am a 25+ year hospitality professional.. Centered around service and rooms and nice and funky.. The service was superb and the food was exceptional.. My days here are always perfect, the staff , food ,views, room are all amazing.. Never had to wait for a car almost never in my life so hope they improve this part of their service next time.. The drinks were refreshing and the service was excellent.. It was a wonderful experience with great food and outstanding  service.. Incredible service.. I made a reservation with Michael in reservations who was extremely helpful and sweet.. When a sudden change in my travel plans happened he put me in touch with his manager Raul who was equally as helpful and very flexible due to our circumstances.. If this is the kind of service they show then we can only imagine what it will be like in person.. Faena is a fantastic hotel - gorgeous finishes, amazing staff and so much to do!. The service was great from start to finish.. Everything was incredible, the truffle hash and the Salmon tater tots are to die for...
Service was impecable, if you decide to go, make sure you ask for JP as your server!. He took service to another level. For more information, visit https://www.faena.com/miami-beach or check reviews online to learn more about guest experiences."

Key highlights from guest reviews include: Stayed in a bay view suite.. Our room was excellent and the view was amazing (we had the 30th floor).. Everything at the hotel was top notch, from the staff, to the parking arrangements, to the view, the hotel room, the food, the ambiance.. Secondly, everyone in my group was put on the fourth floor with a view of an air conditioning unit.. Old room, old TV, not very good view, and everything is so expensive.. Look at their reviews for Labor Day Weekend 2022 and you‚Äôll see DOZENS of complaints just like mine.. If you‚Äôre not in the first row on the beach, the other chairs and umbrellas block your view of the ocean.. Room was big with an okay view of the ocean.. People have checkout shock and tend to review all the charges.. Beach and city views are great. Alejandra provided us excellent service on the beach.. The hotel is so amazing but the beach service with Alejandra was a 12/10.. The beach service was amazing!. 10/10 service. Food and drink service at pools and beach was excellent.. Especially Gianni & Iverson who were so helpful and made sure I felt welcomed and appreciated throughout my experience.. Service is so good ‚ô•Ô∏è , there‚Äôs a person works in that hotel his name is RENE he is so so so nice, so helpful and if i need anything he helping me with his heart not just doing his job !. , that man need to be manger cuz his personality and his love and effort for that place , thank for that good service I really appreciate it , and THANK YOU RENE FOR BEING A HARD WORKER AND HELPING US ENJOYING OUR HONEYMOON IN FOUNTAINBLEAU HOTEL!. GOD BLESS YOU AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST IN YOUR LIFE AND YOUR CAREER ü§ôüèº. Could not have asked for better service.. The beach is private and the service is impeccable.. There is plenty to do, they have wonderful amenities, and top shelf service.. Beach was great, beach service was on point, quick, and cordial.. Despite extremely friendly staff, I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the room and service for $500 a night!. --And, rom service completely shuts down the hour before lunch, so you can't have food at noon.. Staff were rude and pretentious and often seemed offended to be asked to assist with even a minor request.. The wait staff were inattentive and we left early.. Someone tried to break into my room in the middle of the night and hotel staff didn‚Äôt care and did nothing about it.. Bringing it up to the hotel, they didn‚Äôt even care.. Check-in: there was a long line and 1 staff.. When you call guest services, no one EVER answers.. None of the staff know where anything is.. Overcrowded (could not find a chair anytime after 9:30 AM), filthy pools, NO pool drink service, non-existent housekeeping service.. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE at this overpriced and underserviced hotel ever again.. Totally overpriced for the service and room.. a water and gatorade for $20......18"" tip is added to everything which is annoying and unnecessary... we contacted room service, they said they would bring up what we asked for in 20 min.... never came at all.. Everything at the hotel was top notch, from the staff, to the parking arrangements, to the view, the hotel room, the food, the ambiance.. And our fellow guests and even the staff members were amazing people to talk to, from the four corners of the world.. How many times can you say that you *could* spend hours talking to the staff that was taking care of you at a hotel?. There are people who hate their job, staff that ""just work here"" and then there is the staff at the Fontaineblue who truly enjoy being there, and making a guest feel special.. So I took matters into my own hands and ordered one on Amazon and it was delivered today but I still have not seen it after contacting guest services twice and going to the front desk, so now I will endure a second day without coffee because I can‚Äôt get the coffee maker I bought!. Zero to minimal service either.. We stayed at the blue and really found it to be beautiful and pool attendant Rene was super cool and helpful.. The service on the beach was amazing with Alejandra she was very nice and attentive.. The service in general is great even the staff saying hi when you walk by and asking if you need anything.. $86 room service.. It‚Äôs the first time I saw a hotel which you have to wait for ten minutes for calling the room service, and in which you get charged immediately for water in room you picked up of 4 times its original price.. Excellent service.. Friendly and helpful.. You‚Äôll be sitting on the lawn in direct sunlight if you don‚Äôt tip upfront and tip well, almost create a contract with the attendant that they take care of you and your family for the trip- want to feel special or feel like a loser?. Oh, and the staff are miserable.. The Front Desk Agent was extremely nice and helpful.. Banquet staff was great.. Even though every F&B staff member knows there's an auto-gratuity, they ALL hit you with the line as if trained to do so: ""I don't receive any of that auto-gratuity so if you add more to the Tip line, I'll actually get that"" - if this is true, shame on the Hotel - if this is not true, then some major corrective training needs to be done with the staff.. The staff was all rude with the exception of the burger joint server and a few young ladies at the coffee place.. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a Miami thing or what (added gratuity not needing to be earned), but staff just was below subpar.. He said they took care of him which I am happy to hear because it was the first day of his stay.. Worst service ever.. It was a pleasure to spend the afternoon at the beach at the fontainebleu and relax while getting great food and drink service.. Worst and laziest service ever.. I am honestly pretty shocked and appalled at the poor customer service here - worsened by the fact they do auto-gratuity on everything.. I heard a person cleaning the pool area (well before sunset which is when they say it closes) tell a kid who asked if they had clean towels out that no but ‚Äúover there are the dirty ones and you can help yourself.‚Ä?They ought to remove the auto-gratuity and maybe people would care about their customer service - I am happy to tip generously when I‚Äôm not getting treated like I‚Äôm annoying the person by being there.. The food and beverage service experience depends on the server.. Room cleaning service is good.. One day on the beach they (food and beverage service) held my room pass card until I left for the day.. She was very helpful!. At the pool the staff was somewhat attentive although it was a very busy time.. I do specifically note in ALL CAPS that one staff member at the pool was exceptional/5 stars in all categories, his name is English.. Love the pool and beach staff.. They always remember us and take care of us each time we are there.. Our trip was great and we were well taken care of by Rene and English each day at the pool.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: We had an amazing view of the ocean from our room and we loved the KitKats upon checkout!. I would like to leave this review and say that Tomas was really helpful.. View from room was poor.. We had room 524, a corner room with a view overlooking Collins Ave and the Atlantic. The staff was very helpful for our extended stay during the Miami Boat Show!. Especially Dario, Tomas and all the front desk staff.. The hotel staff was superb.. Front desk staff very attentive and friendly.. We had an amazing stay, beginning with Karen at the front desk who provided exceptional customer service.. Martina and Nicole, both in the front desk,  provided us with great service.. Always nice and helpful, they gave us great tips on how to move around the city.. Marina, the woman at the desk was very sweet and helpful.. Also, the  friendly, caring, and pleasant staff, starting from the reception (Dario).. They took good care of us.. I would probably choose it again next time, because I loved the experience of warm welcomes of the staff, excellent service and pleasantness of hotel crew.. Martina and Karen at front desk were very welcoming, helpful and friendly.. We arrived early and Karen at the front desk was extremely helpful in getting us an early check in as well as keeping our suitcases as we went to the beach as they got the room ready.. All staff members were friendly and helpful.. Great service (especially from Tomas).. Couldn't ask for more or service.. Nicole at the front desk was very professional and friendly, always helpful with any requests.. The breakfast attendant and cleaning staff were top notch.. The staff was incredible.. I would like to leave this review and say that Tomas was really helpful.. He was also responsible for securing that my family and I were taken care of.. This is an employee that should be rewarded for such good customer service.. The service at the hotel is amazing.. Great service, clean room, easy check in and out, nice area.. Staff was very friendly.. Excellent service.. Thanks to the wonderful staff at this hotel.. Honestly Adrian‚Äôs friendly, calm, and collected service made all the difference.. Adrian was so helpful and we‚Äôre so thankful for him!. The person that staffs the breakfast didn't speak any english so hotel guests were unable to communicate when things were out and/or ask if they had certain items.. The customer service is very good.. This hotel is clean, centrally-located, and offers some great amenities, but where they really stand out is customer service.. Highly recommend this property (and hope that upper management recognizes the staff at this location for true excellence in hospitality).. Friendly and helpful staff.. Always a wait peak hours but we went off times and food and service were wonderful.. Good location and great service, special mention to Tomas who is kind and resourceful.. The safe in the room didn't work and the guy at reception wasn't helpful in fixing it.. Very very helpful!. First I‚Äôd like to begin with how helpful and accommodating the front desk attendee Tomaj is.. We arrived super late and were kind of grumpy but he improved our mood by being so helpful because we were tired from a 3 hour drive.. Everyone at the hotel was helpful, pleasant and gracious.. Service is superb, very helpful and friendly staff, Martina, Nicole, Israel and Dario were fantastic!. Olga was extremely helpful in checking us in and giving us all the up to date information on the hotel and area.. The staff is attentive and helpful.. The staff deserve a special mention, simply the best compared to any other hotel we have stayed at.

This hotel offers a range from $450 per night and is ranked #38 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 52 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: It close to all the restaurants and had a great view of the beach.. The roof top hot tub was nice (not as nice as a pool), but generally not very crowded and it had a nice view of the ocean.. There is a little rooftop hang out area on the 4th floor with a view of the ocean.. We checked in to a 2 bedroom and were so disappointed - all 3 windows faced a building, not the view we expected.. The next morning our neighbors left - we were able to check out their room - another 2 bedroom with views of ocean drive and a sit down kitchen table with 6 chairs.. Unfortunately, if one is in the hot tub, there is no view of the beach or surrounding area.. Easy access to all south beach has to offer.Stayed on 3rd floor with amazing views of ocean dr and the ocean.A bit tricky with parking arrangements and luggage considering ocean dr doesn‚Äôt allow traffic. The staff was excellent.. Tall Paul was always around (does that guy get any time off) to help and the front desk staff was always nice and helpful.. It is the quietest part of Ocean Drive but some service vehicles will use the alley directly behind the building and right under us.. Staff are helpful.. The staff is incredibly helpful and accommodating.. The front desk had recommendations for parking and was so helpful navigating us through the busy streets.. We immediately asked to move and were told they were understaffed and couldn't clean our room in order to move us.. The staff was always pleasant - The location is great.. The amazing staff was friendly and helpful: Carone, Rose, Tall Paul and Paloma took such good care of us and gave great recommendations and tips about what to do and see.. Stay here and let the great staff pamper you!. That said, it is well done, well maintained, clean, and staff are excellent.. Hideabed has one blanket, may need another, room service is good and brought an additional one up.. Accommodation is decent but not grand, staff are friendly , Tall Paul helpful, it just delivers.. During check-in, the hotel staff said that we could park at the nearest intersection at 14th and Ocean Drive and unload there.. The staff was really friendly and gave us plenty of recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants.. Helpful and nice staff.. The staff were very friendly and attentive!. The staff members were amazing and accommodating to our needs.. On day 2 of a 7 day stay the elevator was put out of service.. The only bright spot to this situation was Tall Paul the bellman who was very pleasant and helpful, and not the front desk staff who kept aledging the elevator was being worked on.. We have stayed here year after year for the location and the friendly service.. The doorman will meet you by The Betsy Hotel and take your luggage to check-in, but you have to call to coordinate this service.. Their (presumed Direct TV/satellite) TV service kept getting interrupted with numerous ""Lost Signal"" error messages.. The staff is friendly and, generally, the property seems well maintained.. Arlene, the assistant manager, was most helpful during our stay.. The Hilton McAlpin is amazing - great location, steps away from delicious food and the beautiful beach, perfectly clean, and the staff is accommodating and welcoming!. Parking situation is terrible, while the service staff were okay, front desk had no staff during long periods,  washer dryer were old and located in 1 floor only!!. Staff was excellent and helpful!. The staff at the Mac Alpin did everything to ensure a great vacation.. Amazing location, right on the strip on ocean drive, walking distance to everything you need and great service from the Hilton team.. The staff was great.. Except for the cleaning guy and the front desk guy the day I arrived, all the other staff were unfriendly.. I expected that the staff member would have provided at least a bottle of water for the night.

This hotel offers a range from $164 - $276 per night and is ranked #15 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 99 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: My review would have been less than average if it wasn't for Lily at the front desk, far and away this hotel's best asset.. However, Lily resolved the issue quickly by moving us to an even nicer room with a better view (and lots of hot water).. The room was spotless, very nice views, and extremely comfortable; we don‚Äôt even want to leave.. I never leave reviews but I HAD to.. It was near everything, majority of the things we did were walking distance and the room had a good view of the beach and strip so you could see what was going on.. I had partly ocean view and pool view from my room .. The lady mentioned in a number of other reviews IS very helpful.. 1) I reserved an ocean view room (more expensive) and you can see the picture from our room, you have to look to see about an inch of the ocean.. I paid extra for an ocean view and I might as well have saved my money.. Nice Ocean View if requested when booking. Lily could not have been more accommodating, helpful, friendly and just an absolute pleasure to deal with.. My husband and I have stayed at Breakwater for the last 3-4 years and the service never changes.. Customer service is top tier and it's what keeps us coming back.. They remembered our faces and names and we were met with nothing but great customer service that continued throughout our stay.. The customer service is what makes this our ""forever hotel"".. Thank you so much to 
Kai
Elsa
Sekene
Estephanie and
Dania
for the top notch hospitality and customer service.. The staff at this establishment are all so friendly, helpful and totally welcoming.. Lily and all the front desk staff are a total asset to this establishment.. Thank you Lily and all the wonderful staff at Breakwater for making our first visit to Miami extremely memorable.. All the front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful, but Lily was a real stand-out and sincerely cared that guests were comfortable and happy.. The staff i the front desk was not helpful and not given any solution.. The hotel front staff went to the back of the room to speak to her manager to see what could be resolved.. When I told staff I was going to call police for the fraud that I was charge from 3 room miraculously she wanted to give a champagne bottle to see if iwoild please with.. Hotel belleza where I was greeted and treated like I matter and was given the treat and service that I wish this hotel can mirror and fixed.. The hotel staff is incredible.. The staff / Lily, Elsa and Sami was very helpful, when we asked for a quiet room and was throughout attentive during our stay.. It wasn‚Äôt the worst but definitely not what I expected‚Ä?the rooms are in a separate building and the service is below average.. Super friendly staff.. Miami is very nice clean big crazy city 

The rooms where very big & clean , very helpful staff.. Good price, excellent staff so attentive and friendly!. Staff, Lily,Kai,Elza were amazing.. Very polite,helpful, answered all our questions.. Although our stay was interrupted by outside Spring Break chaos, the hotel staff was very accommodating and cordial, in particular, Dania and Estephanie.. Extra special thanks to Lily, Mery, Kai, Dania, Gustavo & Mario‚ÄîAWESOME staff and the BEST customer service at every request, any hour of the day/night.. Overlooking South Beach with good soundproofing from bar music at night 
Fabulous team of helpful staff.. Super friendly staff!. The hotel is very nice very comfortable good location in front oh the beach the staff is very nice and Elsa is amazing person she help me with everything i stayed here for 12 days and she helps me with suggestions and plans for do in miami because was my first time.. Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating.. the hotel staff very welcoming, very pleasant and very professional.. They provided a hospitality that was off the chart.. The icing on the cake came when it was time to check out, Lilly provided the same  hospitality.. Thank you Hotel Breakwater staff, for making our birthday celebration one to always remember.. Lily, Elsa, Kai, and Gustavo greeted us warmly and took care of every need.. We had pleasant conversations and he took care of our loud music problem when it crested on the 2nd night.. Elsa, Kai, and many others took care of our bikes, towels, and every other need and it was nice seeing these faces see us with recognition as we came through or when we needed something.. We were met by hotel staff Lily, Elsa, and Hector.. The service and attention they provided was outstanding!. The room service was great !. Lilly is very kind and helpful .. She always smiles and  takes care of all details !. The food is delicious and the service very nice .. The staff was amazing.. Lily, Elsa, and Hector took care of us from check in to check out.. They were helpful when it came to early check in for my balcony room, local spots to check out, free chairs for the beach which is across the street, and more.. Definitely one of my new fav hotels to stay in Miami with the pricing l, staff and location of Hotel Breakwater. The staff was very welcoming and helpful.. If you would like to get a good vibe of South Beach, and also avoid stress related to big hotel chains with cold concierge/staff in the mean time, then I would definitely recommend this hotel with its great staff.. Inconsistent service and overrated are the first adjectives that come to mind having just left a four night stay.. The lady mentioned in a number of other reviews IS very helpful.. Trouble is the rest of the staff.. When we checked out I expected something like ‚Äúthanks for staying with us‚Ä?at least, but the front desk staff is untrained in these niceties.. The infinity pool, the restaurants and entertainment just out outside the door, complimentary water, very clean and safe environment in an excellent location with valet service, were all qualities that made this stay top notch.. I only give this hotel a 2 because of the friendliness of the front desk staff and the location to the beach.. Even the night front desk staff was great, though I never got their names.. What a lovely surprise to stay at the Breakwater great welcoming staff and a lovely clean and perfectly situated hotel.. It's a little more than we would expect to pay for a similar hotel elsewhere, however when you look at the other options, this is by far your best bet if you want a big room, great location and awesome staff.. She was the most uplifting positive helpful person i have come across at a front desk in years.. We had to call 3 times to get them.maid in the hall was unhelpful and said call housekeeping, we thought she was housekeeping üòÇ. We travel a lot and the Breakwater especially Lily by far was the best Hospitality we have ever received and when we return to South Beach we will be staying at the Breakwater again because of the front desk.. The Management at Breakwater needs to know how lucky they are to have such a great front desk staff especially Lily!. Great first impression of the hotel with the great customer service!. The service at the front desk was great.. Lily and Kai took good care of us.. We also received a card to show staff incase we wanted to take advantage of the pool while we waited.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: There is numerus shops and restaurants walking distance and a rooftop pool with stunning views.. ‚ÄãThe location and amenities are perfect given the ever-changing landscape of Sobe.. The view and room were great.. I rarely write reviews but I had to share the pleasant stay at Hotel Greystone.. But this is my current view attached‚Ä?it doesn‚Äôt feel like an upgrade. Friendly staff, spotless hotel - I could go on‚Ä? All of the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating.. On our arrival we were greeted warmly by Emily, in fact every member of staff we met were so friendly, professional and helpful during our three night stay.. Had a meal in the beautiful S√©r√™v√®ne Restaurant, the food was delicious and once again the staff and service was excellent throughout!!. Private, friendly staff, amazing restaurant and cafe.. If you are in search for a centralized location with great staff & hospitality this is the perfect Miami spot.. I'm a picky eater and I was able to find delicious food options thanks to the great restaurant staff.. Jordan & Leah at the Front desk took great care of me.. Staff is welcoming and helpful.. Thank you to all the staff and front desk for your hard work.. Beautiful rooms, excellent staff, and a very convenient location made our stay memorable.. The service was fantastic from the front desk to the coffee cart for breakfast, everyone was attentive and friendly.. The staff were a pleasure to work with; shout out to Leah at the front desk and Pia at the pool deck.. They provided excellent service in a friendly and timely manner.. The staff is‚Ä?incredibly professional yet low-key.. The staff here are very friendly.. Staff was courteous and helpful.. Great location and excellent customer service.. The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant on site was delicious.. Jordan and Staff were extremely friendly and welcoming and made our quick stay very enjoyable!. Very welcoming staff, extremely clean, ideal location, and the on-site restaurant is remarkable!. We booked a lot of reservations and they were more than able to accommodate us at no hesitation and extremely professional (shoutout to Stephanie - director of sales for taking care of us and making the reservation situation smooth).. Everyone from Pedro the manager, Castro and Jordan at the front desk and even Pia the pool employee are exactly what you look for when getting a five star service at a hotel.. Friendly service at reception and Kobo cafe (appreciated morning coffee and croissant).. The staff in the cafe so bubbly and positive first thing in the morning, every day.. The front desk staff, particularly Jordan and Leah were nothing short of amazing throughout our stay.. The location was perfect, rooms lovely, staff friendly and it has a beautiful rooftop pool.. The staff was always very nice and made us feel welcome.. We were immediately greeted by the friendly staff at the front desk who are so welcoming and genuinely interested to hear about your day.. Hotel staff were accommodating, knowledgeable and neighborly.. He was very helpful and polite, and the team had made sure to reserve our nice King room facing north towards 20th Street.. Lastly, big shout out to Tonya who takes care of the complimentary coffee and pastries in the morning.. Great hotel in a great location with friendly staff and modern/stylish rooms!. Basic comes in the form of a tiny room outside the main building that is frankly a pretty long walk from the lobby and up and down several sets of stairs; in the room, there is no closet to speak of, but a curtain (not a door) hung over a tiny area facing the bedroom; no desk at all, no work area, no chair or any seating area, no tissues to be found anywhere, TV service that is extremely minimal in terms of channel choices (and quality); when I asked for access to a private space in the hotel with a chair to conduct a business meeting by Zoom on one occasion, I was told the hotel has no private space in which I could sit, not a single conference room or even an office where I could sit and have a Zoom meeting.. On the plus side, the staff was generally pretty friendly, especially the daytime staff, with staff service trailing off in the later hours; and the restaurant was beautiful and quite good, although wildly overpriced.. The staff is very friendly and helpful.. From the moment I arrived I had a great welcome with service.. The front desk staff was outstanding.. Very helpful and accommodating.. The staff, rooms, and property were all amazing.. The staff was pleasant and helpful.. Hotel has some redeeming qualities like a really nice cleaning staff always eager to help, location, and art deco.. Because the hotel does not warn you when asked for a quiet room at reservation or at check in, and clearly lacks tact and does not care about comfort of the guests versus partying of other guests and outsiders.. First off, the hotel is adorable and the staff have been very friendly.. I work in upper management food service and I know the cost of food isn‚Äôt good , but croissants and danishes (which I didn‚Äôt see cause they were gone) isn‚Äôt a healthy breakfast‚Ä?I‚Äôll have to go and spend more money elsewhere to get protein, vitamins from fruits or juices, etc.. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, the rooms are immaculate.. Location  perfect
staff          competent, helpful, ready to solve any problem, always with a nice smile !. Staff was friendly, helpful and enthusiastic.. Staff, accomodations, location were great!. Plus, there is free coffee and pastries in the morning and the staff is super friendly and helpful.. The highlight were features such as the extremely comfortable room, designed hotel room, lobby, bar and restaurant interior and most importantly, the staff.. Especially Kelli, the warm-hearted young lady who basically manages everything for her guests with all her efforts üôèüèº She is great and tries to take care of all of your needs... We couldn‚Äôt have asked for better service!. To top it off, the location of the hotel was EXCELLENT, the room was super clean, and all of the staff were incredibly helpful.

This hotel offers a range from $108 - $186 per night and is ranked #60 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 1 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: Without a car, I would probably give this a review of 4 or 5 stars.. What our room lacks in views is made up for by being very quiet in a very bustling South Miami Beach neighborhood. They all just went to a 'not in service' announcement.. Michael and the front desk staff were fantastic.. Hotel is advertised on AGODA for $87/night

However, there is an ADDITIONAL ""service charge"" of $198.00

A complete fraud.. If you are the owner of this property, I hope you find my comments helpful and can improve on them.. Valet staff was polite and professional

Note:  that after talking to people, the city of Miami Beach put up special barricades that blocked off any turns on or off Collins St this year for spring break.. It's the same Valet service.. Part 2 of the 1 star rating:  The second clerk, that was so helpful, gave me the phone number of the property management company, so I could tell them about our experience.. You need to train and screen your staff.. In addition to the false advertising and poor client service, the room was extremely cold (no heating at at hotel) and noisy.. The staff was nice and friendly, and I was especially grateful for the stash of sunblock they had behind the desk (my stay was short so I was grateful to be able to borrow a bottle for the day).. Also, probably due to staff shortages, there was no one on site at the Impala.. Special shoutout to John and Carlos for their smiles and hospitality :).. When I returned to the booking page I noticed that further down on the screen, in tiny light gray print, is a fee disclosure of $209.20 and an additional 14% service charge.. The room was very clean the ac worked beautifully üíó save the best for last the front desk guy Carlos was superrrrrrrrrrrer and helpful.. The rooms are huge and sthe staff are very polite.. To start with there were no hotel staff at the desk to check-in along with two fully passed out people in in lobby.

This hotel offers a range from $199 - $333 per night and is ranked #48 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 50 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: I've read some of the reviews about the noise at this hotel.. Tucked between a vacant lot surrounded by chain link fencing and filled with trash and landscape debris and an alley filled with overflowing garbage cans.. Ah, last but not least, the ‚ÄúCourtyard View.‚Ä?This is an insult to the intelligence.. I had a fairly decent stay, but it was NOT as close to certain activities as some of the reviewers made it seem.. I stayed on the 1st floor and although some reviewers complained of noise, I had NO such issue.. We want to leave a positive review for the kind staff at kayak hotel for all they did to make our stay complete.. In fact this is my very first review ever.. I was misled by the positive reviews on Tripadvisor for this hotel that I find hard to believe are legitimate,  Because I had a work conference at the Convention Center I chose this hotel because it was only 10 minutes away & had good reviews.. There‚Äôs a bar plus the restaurant on the main level which outdoor dining with a view.. There are lots of plants but also good views of the surrounding area. Water pours from the electrical light fixtures on the ""rooftop terrace"" whenever it rains, the front desk is almost always unattended, no room service for 7 nights even with placard hung requesting same.. The staff is very accommodating.. She is so knowledgeable and helpful and her recommendations were on point!. Staff at the hotel and the restaurant (layla) were very friendly and helpful.. As we checked in we were greeted by Essence and Marge who were extremely friendly and helpful!. I knew we were headed downhill when a very nice man, located near what appeared to be a front desk, told me that check in was ‚Äúself service.‚Ä?HUH?. It‚Äôs a  deflating, and depressing reality in our world: Human kindness, personal interaction, the feeling that you are literally someone‚Äôs ‚Äúguest‚Ä?is disappearing--not just from  the hotel industry but the service industry in toto.. Personal, charming front desk staff.. All of the comfort , easy style and service delivery of those big brand boutique hotels (yes you know the ones ), but without the pomp or stuffiness that can go with them.. Thank you Albert, for your kind hospitality and to be  present for any needs.. Although there was only 1 roll of tissue in the room upon my arrival, staff was pretty good about bringing another roll when asked.. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.. I had that issue and since I had to do that I did not get housekeeping services done because I put the request on the old reservation.. Loved the ambiance, vibe and the customer service.. Always helpful, accommodating, great energy and looked out for us the entire time we were there.. I loved the carefully curated attention to detail from the signature scent that greets you each time you enter the lobby, the music playlist was always a vibe,  daily fruit infused water to the luxury brand toiletries in the bathrooms.. From the moment we arrived the night manager, Larry took excellent care of us.. All of the staff , from the front desk, restaurant, bar to housekeeping were genuinely friendly, hospitable and made us feel comfortable .. We want to leave a positive review for the kind staff at kayak hotel for all they did to make our stay complete.. We spent time chatting with some of the other staff and bartenders such a Daniel, Arie and Max who were absolutely incredible to us.If you have the opportunity to stay here- don't pass it up!. We are still reminiscing about our experience and talking about how awesome the staff was who work there.. The employees and staff really do make all the  difference....Thank you!. Being a little of an older gent i always let me wife take care of these sort of things.. I say all this because i appreciated every aspect of the care the Kayak flagship hotel has created with an amazing staff.. If i were in the hospitality business i would do everything i could to hire the away and pay top wages because they are the reason this new concept will thrive.. Well, the welcoming was great, Kim made my check in with an smile & helpful, I would love to try restaurant and pool in next few days that Kim highly recommend me!. Although it‚Äôs a boutique hotel, the restaurant Layla was amazing, staff incredibly helpful and friendly, and room very comfortable.. The waiter agreed and actually took our order but come on - we pay for a service not a self-service.. Staff were very nice but they no longer really have jobs they just get to stand around helping you when the digital world doesn‚Äôt work.. Super helpful and warm.. Ask for Federica at the reception she‚Äôs super sweet and helpful!. The hotel, room, staff and restaurant are incredible.. Additionally, the entree I ordered from room service was out so he updated my dinner to a ribeye feast at no additional charge.. The dude knows what ‚Äòhospitality‚Ä?is all about!. The staff were helpful and friendly.. The staff was excellent, the space was so chic, restaurant was amazing and it felt like our home away from home.. Kim was very helpful and the reason of our exceptional stay.. The whole team is nice and helpful, can‚Äôt thank enough the lovely Federica.. Friendly, attentive, helpful and professional.. The staff is very polite and welcoming.. Best Hotel in Miami Beach,Albert and the staff were very helpful, wonderful customer service, the Morocan Vibe, the rooms, the restaurant, roof top, everything was amazing!. The staff was warm and helpful.. All staff members I interacted with were very kind and professional.. In particular, the in-hotel cafe ""Layla"" was a wonderful vibe - food, staff, ambience, music, really made our stay extra great.. The bathroom door did get stuck if you closed it all the way and our TV didn't work except for half a day the whole week we were there but those issues were overshadowed by the WONDERFUL staff, from the Hotel Manager down the line, EVERYONE was super friendly and always helpful.. Albert (the Manager), Patrick (hotel staff) and Sania (Layla restaurant) are particular standouts.. On weekends, guests are able to order room service since the bar and restaurant are very popular.

Kasa El Paseo Miami Beach,"Kasa El Paseo Miami Beach is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 405 Espanola Way, Miami Beach, FL 33139-8152. This hotel offers a range from $130 - $229 per night and is ranked #37 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 71 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: We read some reviews about noise during the night, but our room was at the end of Espa√±ola Way, and was a normal one.. The television had to pair with your phone and use your own app to view.. I also wish that we would have gotten one of the rooms on the outside with some sort of view, our only view was of the the windows of other rooms.. It is in the core of south beach, next to public transportation (going to airport or downtown in about 25 min), two corners away from the beach, directly next to the best restaurants with highest reviews of all south beach.. But, I spent most of my time in the bedroom relaxing on the king bed while viewing the large mounted television.. The view of a parking lot and an overgrown palm tree.. When we asked for a room with a view (after checking the website for availability, which they had) we were told,  NO.. We said we would like a view, since the price is the same, and were told it would be noisy if we got a balcony.. We understood that but only wanted a decent window view instead of a dark ""courtyard"".!. When they finally got into their room, the landscapers were having a great time yelling over the leaf blowers, which was directly  outside the small window.. RUN AWAY TO BETTER  HOTELS WITH A VIEW!. We enjoyed the wine social hour on their (small but great view ) balcony overlooking Espanola st. It is true that there is no a front desk agent on site and no housekeeping service daily but who needs all that, I loved the roku attached to the tv where you can watch the news and any internet service you may belong to, also there is a small living room.area for you to enjoy with a microwave and a balcony to relax and have a drink.. He was so friendly and helpful and made sure to always ask if I needed anything else in the room‚Ä?more coffee, bath towels, beach towels, etc.. The communication was amazing, anything you need, they will take care of you, I even asked for an early check out at 1pm, and no problem, they provided that.. Despite these couple of things, I would still say that our experience overall was good, the virtual front desk was simple/easy, the staff were always attentive and replied back almost immediately to text messages and were helpful, polite and courteous.. The parking garage does not offer in and out service like the valet.. This is called dishonesty, not to mention horrible customer service.. We met the staff at a Meet and Greet.. Price are really low compared to the other hotels and this is probably because they removed all unnecessary things that are costly: you don't have a person in the lobby 24 /7, they don't have room service, housekeeping etc.. So their service is still amazing and personalised despite a virtual lobby.. Friendly and courteous staff, stairs to third floors added to the charm.. Hotel customer service was 6 out if 10.. Only two staff were extremely helpful.. The neighborhood felt safe and the staff was friendly and always available.. The rooms were clean and the staff friendly.. Was immediately impressed by the employees, Daniel and Ignacio were always so helpful and very kind.. The staff is friendly and attentive.. Best part of this hotel is the fantastic staff.. Good for business, vacation, or romantic getaway and the staff will accommodate your needs.. From check-in to check-out, service was impeccable!. Khalil,  Daniel and Katherine provided outstanding customer service.. Staff was friendly.. The staff is very professional, kind and my thanks to Khalil that was very helpful providing hints and reservations for Miami.. The staff were also very nice and the room I stayed in was spacious, comfortable and well designed.. Service and rooms are 5 STAR!!!. The staff at the hotel were sooooo friendly and helpful from the moment we arrive to when we left.. We were very pleased with the location and the service received at this hotel.. The staff was genuinely interested in our stay and made sure we were taken care of.. Staff was friendly and helped with carrying luggage as there are no elevators.. THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COMFORT OF THEIR GUESTS.. We loved the wine hour and the beach chair service.. Most importantly, the service was impeccable.. If you are seeking the friendliest, most attentive staff; an immaculately clean hotel; and an affordable and fun little get-a-way in the heart of South Beach... go to El Paseo!!. Malwine, the receptionist is the sweetest and was very helpful with everything.. The accommodations are fantastic, the staff is always courteous and helpful whether it's a personal issue or assisting our team with commercial requests.. And, the front desk staff was very obliging - courteously insistent in bringing our luggage up the 3rd floor in this elevator-less hotel.. Specifically, they are continuing to use the virus as an excuse for NO or severely reduced and erratic room services.. Upon check-in, we were advised that normal room service was not available.. It has become obvious that this hotel is using the pandemic for an excuse to not hire replacement housekeeping staff following illness and normal attrition losses.. But service - Poor.. If they want to cut staff, don't continue to charge double and triple the room price for a weekend stay.. The service was top notch, friendly and professional.. Excellent staff, accommodations, location.. The staff were all so nice and helpful.. It is a boutique hotel that sits smack dab in the middle of the busiest party street on south beach so you wouldn‚Äôt know how clean the hotel is, how courteous and how accommodating the staff is unless you saw it for yourself.. OH‚Ä?last thing‚Ä?. their rooms are even moderately priced; you can‚Äôt find this kind of value, cleanliness, location, party atmosphere, and service anywhere else on SOBE right now, and especially for this price, PERIOD!

This hotel offers a range from $214 - $402 per night and is ranked #35 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 132 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: The rooftop pool is spacious with attentive towel service and city views.. As others point out in their loft suite reviews, Room 116 felt humid and musty, and the bathrooms have not been updated and do not look like the ones in the marketing photos.. Other reviewers have pointed out that the new building is in better shape than the loft suites or the rooms located in the Seawell Fish & Oyster building.. I do not usually leave reviews but the service was but the staff at Kimpton really went above & beyond.. In fact, I have never had such a bad experience at any property before that I felt the need to write a review.. Reading the reviews of the Kimpton Anglers, they are mostly positive.. However there were not any kind of views but walls or windows.. As it was our anniversary  i booked a premium king with balcony and asked for a room with a nice view,  the hotel upgraded us to a spa suite, & there was a bottle of wine and small crackers and spread gift which was a lovely thought and really appreciated, and also as IHG members we were able to check out at 2pm. Luciana at the front desk is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.. The rooftop pool is spacious with attentive towel service and city views.. Food and beverage staff were friendly.. Morning coffee service was conveniently served in Seawell Fish & Oyster.. CONS:  This is a high-traffic property that feels understaffed.. Staff knowledge and helpfulness was uneven at the front desk (Luciana was great, her male colleagues less so).. Rooftop pool bar and food coverage was short-staffed and not always immediately available.. Staff acknowledged room maintenance issues had been previously reported but not addressed, including a broken cabinet door that had caused floor damage and shower drainage issues in Room 309.. Guest services responded to text message requests, although sometimes reminders were needed and it took more than an hour or two for things that were desired quickly, (e.g.. Very clean hotel, friendly staff and its location is perfectly placed in South Beach.. The hotel is great and right on par for a well appointed Kimpton, but what made this hotel 5 star was the AMAZING staff!. I cannot say enough positive things about how client focused, kind, fun and caring the Angler's staff all are.. I have worked in high-end hospitality for 2 decades and there is nothing better than being acknowledged and treated with courtesy.. Whereas this should be the norm, it is now becoming the exception and when I encounter 5 star service, I do not forget!. They took care of us when we arrived at 3am UK time and especially when my husband had to go to hospital!. They made everything feel like it would be ok. All the staff here are polite and cannot do enough for you.. Our room was lovely and great for our family of 4, brunch was great, and we loved the location, close to the beach whilst the pool with its complimentary towels and great bar service was a hit with our teens who liked the music and vibe!. This is a great Miami Beach hotel which is superbly run by people who care about great service.. Never got service or a drink as bar staff to busy partying amongst themselves.. THANK YOU WONDERFUL STAFF OF KIMPTON ANGLER HOTEL FOR A WONDERFUL STAY AND FOR OVERNIGHTING A PIECE OF JEWELRY I LEFT IN THE SAFE!. After coming home, we received a phone call from the staff about an item left behind.. Great hospitality, great people and new/clean rooms!. The hotel has complimentary towels and Banana Boat Factor 50 sunscreen available, as well as chilled water on the pool deck
We did not eat in the hotel, but they have a happy hour every evening for free drinks
I must make a special mention to the reception staff, who assisted me when I realised, when I had passed security at the airport, that I had left my iPad in a drawer in the hotel room.. All staff go above and beyond to provide the best service - and then go beyond that.. The Staff were so amazing!. 
What a great Hotel to stay in, we were so well looked after and the staff were always available to help.. Exceptional service even before we arrived.. That said all of the staff were excellent thank you‚Ä¶The hotel is just perfect, the bar area and  pool areas are incredibly relaxing .the hotel is in an ideal position for South Beach‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt imagine there is a better place to stay‚Ä? I do not usually leave reviews but the service was but the staff at Kimpton really went above & beyond.. Hossain, Chawki, Gabriel & Luciana were all pleasant and super helpful.. We stayed here for a girls' weekend & it was a carefree trip in large part thanks to their welcoming attitude.. The beds were comfortable, the cleaning service is impeccable and the rooftop pool is a great place to lounge around.. Even though they offer free coffee/tea in the morning and a wine bar in the evening, what is the point if the service is so terrible and the room is of a 2 star quality.. Staff was very attentive.. Hussein and Chawki were super helpful in making sure I was happy with my room as well as my entire stay.. From the friendly and most helpful front desk staff to the great location, the cleanliness, the pleasant atmosphere, the stylish, chic decor, it all adds up to perfection.. The staff were really good and arranged for us to have a late check out even though they were extremely busy.. Two areas of improvement‚Ä?higher quality of pillows (surprisingly were not up to Kimpton standard) and room service would be nice.. The staff at reception was super helpful and extremely friendly.. Staff is friendly and helpful.. Fast service.... Thank you to all the staff.. The room was clean and very comfortable (although I was not in the room much during my trip, I don't travel to stay in a room),  the staff were all very nice and friendly.. Chris the manager was helpful with giving recommendations in the area, reallynice guy that helped made the trip special.. Service was slow and begrudging.. Not much was offered at this hotel in the way of charm, information or hospitality.. Super friendly and attentive staff
Very cosy reception area with self served lemonade and water.. The staff¬† here is fabulous and helpful.. Next we meet the outgoing truly helpful Madeline¬† whom served wine during wine hour from 5pm to 6pm outside in the court¬† area.. The service from pretty much every employee sucks.. He looked at me quizzically so I asked, ‚ÄúCan you take care of our baggage?‚Ä?He says he can and fetched a cart.. Other than adequate lodging , the level of service we received is what I would expect at a Red Roof Inn, not at a Kimpton property charging premium rates.. Super friendly staff, Nice amenities and complimentary bag with beach towel and you can ask for an umbrella to borrow.. Also a shout out to Hussain who was so helpful.. I will do return to this hotel for the staff
The rooms are clean and pleasant and location is great. Front desk staff were all very kind and helpful, especially Anthony who was very professional yet extremely personable!. As well as the staff.. Their service is excellent also.. Clean and great staff.. Special mention to Hussein for the excellent service...... I showed the front desk staff pictures of the hairs and asked to have the bathroom and specifically the tub cleaned.. The rooms are nice and spacious .. it‚Äôs the second time I stay there only because the front desk staff were beyond helpful.. a guy named hussien went above and beyond to make sure my stay is pleasant .. gave me the exact kind of room I was looking for and catered to the fact I‚Äôm a  man that needs his privacy during his stay.. I‚Äôd definitely stay here again when in Miami .. no surprises were there .. you get what you see online. True professionals - always eager to help and deliver top notch service with a smile.. The staff are really lovely and helpful, however on returning to the UK i have now had an odd charge added to my CC on the day after check out!. As a top IHG Member, me and my group was WELL taken care of during our stay!. Unfortunately, the ground level pool was out of service during our stay but we found the time to utilize the rooftop pool.

Kimpton Hotel Palomar South Beach,"Kimpton Hotel Palomar South Beach is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 1750 Alton Road, Miami Beach, FL 33139. This hotel offers a range from $218 - $365 per night and is ranked #23 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 96 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: I will be back whether it‚Äôs for work or to bring my family to enjoy the rooftop pool and sunset views over the bay.. Review:
I stayed 5 night at Kimpton Palomar South Beach in February.. From the balcony I had a amazing view at the sea between South Beach and Miami.. Location was ok.   Water view is a canel.. My only complaint was that I had paid extra for a ‚ÄòHarbour View Room‚Ä?. The room did face the harbour but the view was obliterated by two large apartment blocks.. Ok I was nervous staying here because of some¬† of the reviews¬† but the wine hour got me sold plus I'm an IHG member,I've never stayed at a Kimpton¬† before and it was just one night before a cruise.. We booked a higher priced room labels ""sunset harbor view"" which featured a balcony.. When I inquired about  a mistake - turns out that we were looking toward ""sunset harbor"" so we had a view toward sunset harbor but did not have a view of a harbor at sunset.. We‚Äôd looked forward to getting a poolside meal but, when we scanned the QR code for the menu, everything was marked ‚Äúunavailable.‚Ä?

Though reviews indicate the pool is ‚Äúheated,‚Ä?I‚Äôd interpret that more as ‚Äúpool is not ice water, but you‚Äôd never call it ‚Äòwarm.‚Äô‚Ä?

I wish we‚Äôd been offered bike helmets and a bike map (different from a regular map), but I only thought of that once we were biking and I realized it was a more daunting ride than I‚Äôd expected.. Also, I booked a room with sunset view overlooking the canal.. I‚Äôm t was a serious waste of money, view was of a building site and storage unit.. This hotel has good reviews, so I was very surprised at what a terrible experience we had.. Upon entering the room we were very disappointed with our view, we had paid for a ""King Premium Terrace Sunset Harbour view"".. There is no water view and it was VERY LOUD.. The rooms are not sound proof and are very deceiving in the pictures in regards to furniture and views you get.. We booked our room a King Premium Terrace Sunset Harbour View.. The photos online showed a waterfront view and a bed, two chairs in the room and a balcony with a table and two chairs

We checked in late and it was difficult to see outside, but there was no table in the room and no chair either.. In the morning when we looked out we just saw buildings, no water view.. We asked to see the manager and were told that the room wasn't in the position the King Premium Terrace Sunset Harbour Views were in because we needed an Accessible Room.. The hotel is amazing , great view close to everything!!. Balcony to watch the world go by (we didn‚Äôt have a bay view).. This is my first time in Miami and he made sure I had a great room and a great view. The location is excellent, and I always love the hospitality each service member brings!. But what made the stay fantastic was the great staff.. I would be careful staying at this hotel as not to be overcharged, or nickel and dimed.. He was so helpful during my stay and suggested great options around the area!. Victor Matos at check-in went above and beyond to accommodate all my needs, he was really friendly and helpful.. It is a really cosy hotel with amazing service located in a relaxing area  The hotel has a great pool at the rooftop.. The checkin was fast and service was really great.. The food was really good and the service was amazing.. Staff was friendly.. Staff friendly, pool very nice.. Great service and very friendly as well.. All the staff I encountered during my stay were amazing and kind.. Huge shoutout to Denise the shuttle driver, she‚Äôs super kind and very helpful with recommendations in the area!!. Great service from Maria she provided the best service during my stay in Miami  I really enjoyed my stayed there and she loved Chloe my dog, she gave gave me some treats and a doggy bed.. Both of them where really helpful during my stay.. The staff working at reception were not able to provide us any information about local amenities, even including the trolley that runs around the city that has a stop right outside the hotel.. At one point, a staff member directed me to look something up on the Internet when I asked a question.. Despite two calls to the staff, no one brought up towels and we had to leave because we got cold after trying to just dry off.. This hotel is wonderful for the service Maria and Valentina checked me and my dog in and were so fast helpful and efficient .. Great service!. They hotel was pretty nice, but this customer service would make me say to stay away.. The hotel offered great services, such as breakfast and housekeeping!. It clearly states that the pool bar is open, and when you ask the hotel staff they give the wrong information.. the guest service here is exceptional !. The only thing that dissappointmented me was room service, sheets had the the impression to be a bit dirty.. The great
The housekeeping staff was excellent‚Äîroom was not only exquisitely clean each day, but they did sweet touches like spread our blanket from home on the bed with the younger girl‚Äôs stuffed animal resting cutely on the pillow.. Daytime desk staff were great and the restaurant is, hands-down, the best hotel/hotel-adjacent restaurant I‚Äôve ever dined at, both in terms of food and service.. Though the front desk gave us a map and explained where to get beach access, a color photo of the correct area showing the beach setup and umbrella colors would be great (even if it‚Äôs just kept at the desk) and clearer instructions would‚Äôve been helpful.. Night and very early morning desk staff were not as helpful or knowledgeable as daytime staff.. Denise was a great driver and she was very helpful.. Great lady, very sweet and helpful.. Reception staff are very good.. Shuttle service was great Denise was awesome very friendly, entertaining and helpful.. The front desk was friendly enough, but the real stand out was the incredibly helpful bellman.. Staff is not properly trained (which I don't blame on them as they were nice), but they don't know to to handle customer service issues.. There are too many hotels in Miami that are in better locations, provide strong customer service, and do not lie to guests.. She quickly met us wherever we were at on the island and made sure we were taken care of.. great hotel, comfortable rooms
I want to emphasize the hospitality of the service and the good predisposition especially of the women at the front desk and also the kindness of Agostin.. Amazing service!. Our amazing experience was made possible by the following staff members Veni, Elias and Maria!. All staff members were wonderful, very friendly and very helpful!. The staff are attentive and friendly, room and bathroom exceptionally well appointed.. Exceptional customer service from Victor Matos at the front desk.

This hotel offers a range from $194 - $397 per night and is ranked #158 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 26 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: At the time of this review, Life House, South of Fifth just opened up (~2 weeks ago), this could play a role of why everything from their website matching the in person vibe. Some staff not trained in hospitality and graciousness, coming across as annoyed and not wanting to get up out of their seat to help you.. The lobby bar was also lovely and the staff were all very helpful and kind.. Reception and bar is insta friendly but service isnt up to scratch.. Hotel staff lethargic and unhelpful.. Beautiful space, kind staff, and an unbeatable location.. Staff was really nice and friendly and we loved the location.. Hotel staff was welcoming and kind throughout our stay!. The staff was super friendly and helpful.. Amazingly warm staff and comfortable amenities at this stylish boutique property!. Beautiful lobby and quick and friendly staff.. The design, staff, and location are awesome though if you need to get a good nights sleep I wouldnt recommend this place.. The design is really well done and thoughtful and the staff are attentive and friendly.. The service was light-touch with only one person working at any one time but generally helpful.. Good music and and a very helpful concierge greeted us as we entered.. Too few electrical outlets, no sink in the bathroom,windows can‚Äôt be opened, bed not comfortable, the staff on the other hand were very nice.. The staff was proactive to ask me how they could help me, and the technology in the hotel made the experience as self serviced asy introverted self would like.. I know, I know..f****g broadband but it did prove a problem over 2 issues where I couldn't communicate with staff.. If this is sorted,  the water pressure in the room is improved and just a little more professional and 'down to earth' approach from a couple of staff I'd rate this little gem 5*s. Looks fab though. The staff were kind and helpful, but the rooms were damp and dirty.. Very bad surprise in my credit card... On the top of everything, it's close to zero service hotel (self check-in, self check-out, no restaurant, no breakfast, no room service, etc.). It‚Äôs so cute, clean, and the staff is wonderful.. The staff are really nice and will gives you amazing recommendations on places to eat.. The staff is friendly and helpful.. Everything was fantastic but what made the stay superb was the friendliness of the staff and their attentiveness.. Service was great and very accommodating, especially if you‚Äôre checking in late.. Had an amazing trip with my family, the hotel was awesome and the staff was even better!. Everyone was super helpful and friendly and the hotel itself was just beautiful!. The level of service is exceptional too.. We had some problems early on, and the staff totally took care of us.. They also make great free coffee in the morning and are just generally friendly and helpful with everything.. The hospitality was unmatched.. The staff was so personable and every one went to great lengths to make sure we had the best stay.. We visited, unknowingly, during a tropical storm, and the staff was equipped with recommendations to make our stay the best it could‚Äôve been given the circumstances.. Great people - so helpful and friendly and a very happy hour for drinks.. Staff regularly goes above and beyond to cater to your needs.. Even after hours, the staff was kind and welcoming.. The music choice is fire, as the staff is all relatively young.. The hotel is an amazing location, beautiful rooms, amazing toiletries and the staff was so attentive.

This hotel offers a range from $329 - $616 per night and is ranked #57 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 790 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: Also the views!. We loved our private Oceanview balcony and liked the modern decor.. Very nice place, great position and kind staff, lost a star because the food could of been better and I understand the turist prices but still very high for what you get, and the view we payed more for wasn't really an ocean view, but overall kind staff and a great experience. View was lovely, a partial view of the beach (see photo), but a highlight was a small balcony where you could gaze at the flocks of pelicans flying by (see photo).. I‚Äôm not one to write reviews, as it‚Äôs not really in my nature.. Beautiful Pool, View and Family Friendly Hotel.. We had originally booked ocean view double on a high floor but to our surprised it was ocean front.. Beautiful views and welcoming staff. Staff are friendly, helpful, and happy to serve.. Such a fun day with great and attentive staff!. Elyzer was our host and he was absolutely astonishing and very welcoming and helpful.. All the staff here were great.. The beach side service and food were so so good.. Great service!. Nice place to sit on the beach, very clean, good drinks and friendly service.. Friendly staff, helpful, and attentive.. Very nice place, great position and kind staff, lost a star because the food could of been better and I understand the turist prices but still very high for what you get, and the view we payed more for wasn't really an ocean view, but overall kind staff and a great experience. I went to enjoy the at Loews and Elyzer was really helpful to make my stay amazing.. great weather, amazing service.. I just want to start off by saying the service here at Loews and with Boucher Brothers is excellent!. Service was slow all around - it took me 3 days to get a fed ex envelope.. The beach area was staffed by some of the most spaced-out individuals we had ever encountered...and it took forever to get a drink.. Thank you Malik for exemplary service and great attitude that made my afternoon that much better.. The service at the beach was great!. He hustled and ran to get us set up and took care of all our food all day.. Elyzer took care of us while we laid out on the beach and enjoyed the sun.. Excellent customer service.. He accommodated all our needs & was very helpful with our stay at the beach!. Elyzer was amazing and gave great service and was a wonderful host!. We got three chairs and an umbrella and it included chair covers and towels and drink/food service from the hotel.. We got right away a text message from the concierge team asking if we needed anything and if everything was ok, ""great service"" we thought, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to inquire about our downgrade, we replied right away, the response came hours later that they were sorry and were going to look into it, the response never came even after a second message being sent later during the day.... Pool service was good and drinks were ok but pricy.. Overall the only good thing was the bar of the hotel also it is not a bad location but its definitely not the service I was expecting to have from a Loews hotel.. A front desk staff that is just pushing through the LONG line of guests in this 790-room hotel, not caring about accuracy.. A hotel that doesn't care about the comfort of its guests.. This hotel doesn't provide VIP service in any way.. A staff that is not thorough in making sure of accuracy or handling situations.. Don‚Äôt expect high level of housekeeping service.. The hotel doesn't have a turn down service, this is the 1st hotel in the Fine Hotel and Resorts program I have ever stayed in that didn't have this service.. The restaurant staff, Beach and pool staff, valet, bellman, and restaurant staff are great.. Everyone made us feel like family and was very helpful, courteous, and accommodating.. The bad: Housekeeping staff, condition of rooms, lack of attention to cleanliness and minor details.. We stayed 3 nights overall and the housekeeping service rating was 2 out of 5 from my perspective.. Front desk staff operates like robots.. Every detail is taken care of and the texting service is top notch.. The pool staff is absolutely amazing.. Arriving at the hotel's front drive, I was told by a staff member that I could not take my own bags into the hotel.. I told staff member that I needed my bag which had a company letter that I needed to check in.. Service was great and the Chandon spritzes were delicious.. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful.. Maritza in the Palm restaurant was great, some of the other staff ignored requests!. Overall hospitality was lacking from this hotel.. I feel like money is a priority over customer service.. The coffee bar in the lobby of the hotel could be improved, bland coffee and slow service.. Beach staff are very helpful.. The staff while mostly helpful, seemed a little clueless if you asked about anything beyond what their job was.. It is actually more like a drop off daycare, and there is an extra charge.. Had such a welcoming experience at the front desk, the receptionist, KIA was so helpful and made my check in experience even better.. Beach service was amazing every day.. Wilmer was especially helpful and kind.. The staff at the pool and beach were accommodating and made an effort to ensure every guest was happy and comfortable.. Absolutely wonderful service.. He was gentle and efficient, we are very pleased with his services.. Service was fast when asking for fridge/microwave to be brought up.. *at check-in, we weren‚Äôt told about any of the services offered or restaurants on site.. Service was friendly, attentive and efficient.. Only minor recommendations for beach dining service and food but still a great hotel.. They also have AMAZING VIP service where they greet you with a VIP rep right when you check in, and then you have text connection to housekeeping/guest services AND text to VIP folks as well.. Nate at the beach was very helpful in getting our large group chairs, towels, and umbrellas set up together.. The vibe is really wonderful and the staff was knowledgeable and classy. Great service.. Beautiful views and welcoming staff.. also Maritza at brkfst was helpful.

Our balcony view of the pool and ocean made our daily views spectacular.. Nice pool area, beautiful beach access, phenomenal views from the 5th floor.. Based on other reviews it seems like some of the rooms need to be updated.. The view is  unbelievable and once again the restaurant staff is just beyond kind, accommodating and fun and it does make a difference when you are on vacation.. Room was simple and clean with the most beautiful view.. Room 323 was oceanfront with a jacuzzi tub, very comfortable bed and great view.. The first floor room felt like it was in the basement with a view of a brick wall.. I will try to keep this review simple and unbias..

Mainly for the wonderful staff but also because of the beautiful place & the small scale of the hotel.. The view is  unbelievable and once again the restaurant staff is just beyond kind, accommodating and fun and it does make a difference when you are on vacation..

Small hotel on the beach clean rooms and great staff feel of a big hotel but very personal.. Staff was very Friendly and Welcoming!. Excellent service, the crew that works at the hotel is AWESOME!. I would suggest the hotel having food service at the hotel.. They didnt care about us hurricane victims.. The customer service, location, and so accommodating.. Reception was super helpful with finding things to do in the area because it was my first time in Miami.. Every staff we interacted with in our 4 day stay was very kind and quick to assist us with anything we needed.. Staff members always had smiles on their faces.. Friendly staff, clean hotel, beautiful pool, within walking distance to many shops and restaurants!. Welcoming staff and a beautiful spot right next to the beach and boardwalk!. I am not the smartest cookie but I do not understand why staff wear mask on there face to not actually have it over their mouth and nose.. Ultimately, staff was not bad and the pool and beach access was the best part of the hotel.. Staff is meeeh.. The staff was nice and it was quite in the hotel.. Friendly staff.

This hotel offers a range from $134 - $244 per night and is ranked #156 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 49 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: We didn't need the ocean view because walking out to the sand was heaven in itself.. Not sure how this place has a review this high.. I was skeptical after reading some reviews but the hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.. Definitely, if you want to have a fun time and enjoy the views of the beach come down to Majestic!!!. We were moved to a different room, but this one did not have even a view outside?. Ocean view King was our room and it was plenty of room, clean, and comfortable.. Disgustingly Dirty and Don‚Äôt Give you the room you paid for if you Booked with Expedia 
Booked this hotel with Expedia a partial ocean view room and did not get an ocean view, not even a partial view or glimpse.. We were on the 3rd floor with an oceaneview room.. Music from restaurant was not as loud as other reviews stated.. Great service and friendly staff too.. Plus I don't care to hear the music and traffic throughout the night so the room was located perfectly.. I have to first start off by saying that this boutique hotel and its staff were impeccable and extremely clean.. I'm heavy on customer service and it made our stay worth it.. Until we see you next time ü§ó
Take care.. I've received multiple text from their automated service which I did not agree to.. The restaurant must have closed earlier but the kitchen staff was either having their own party or was cleaning the place and washing dishes that went on loud and relentless past 3AM.. It was useless to get out of bed and confront the staff.. The staff was either indifferent or outright rude!. Excellent time, friendly staff and great service.. The staff was very welcoming and hospitalable.. The resort staff were amazing and friendly.. Got the best service ever.. I booked my room with breakfast, and the person on desk said that I didn't have a right to use the voucher, and just at last day I could use this, the staff put the blame in a third part, and just said ""I¬¥m sorry, I cant refund you about this mistake"".. The services is so expensive, such as valet and I had to spend $25.00 for 5 packed on the reception.. I was skeptical after reading some reviews but the hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.. It appeared to be no lack of wait staff and they were all timely and attentive to me and others around me.. I will add that even during my leaving and using the cane and pulling my bag, the Ocean Sevens wait staff were very quick to reach out to assist me as I made my way to the sidewalk for transportation.. There is a valet service and pull in area for UBER/LYFT making your quick and easy to access.. The guy working the front desk did not care, said we can leave or he can have the room cleaned.. This is run down, poor service.. He took care of us and was constantly checking on us if we needed anything.. Easy and accessible to enter even walking up 5 small steps to the ‚ú?in counter top..I stayed in room # 159...It was so easy and convenient to get to, and it was nice and comfortable, the room as well plenty of items such as towels, soap, even shampoo üß¥üß¥ bottles in your shower already filled...This hotel used a really nice system of checks and balances, to help get you what you need or want, Ivy was the name of the inter active service, used to (text) or message you every morning or evening, to ask how things are or were going, and to ask you if you needed anything else, the response time was usually 5 minutes or LESS.... Staff was very helpful and informative.. Great staff, food and cocktails.. Jess at the desk was super helpful and accommodating.. He also told me to make a complaint so, Management will maybe do something about it because they do this all the time (overbook) and don‚Äôt care and they‚Äôre left to deal with unhappy guests.. and the hotel old, but it‚Äôs clean, very neat, friendly staff and close to everything!!!. Thanks for providing a great service.. The night front  desk staff are very friendly as well.. Thanks again for the excellent service and experience.. The restaurant in the lobby was packed, but no one was at the front desk, and the restaurant staff was unable to help us.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: I am submitting this review primarily to show our appreciation to Dalton at the Front Desk.. I don't typically write reviews, particularly bad reviews.. I‚Äôm 52 years old and never given a bad review but I wish I could give them zero stars!. The views from our room were  of the ocean.. And while some have ocean views, even the city views are worth it.. Views are lovely, of both the ocean and of town town Miami.. He ensured I was having a good time by giving me the prime location to view the ocean.. Front row view of the beach with blue and turquoise waters.. I been here with a friend of mine  to have a relaxing day , when we get here the guys where so friendly to us and help us to decide the place and the best view  for me is 5 star on everything i love the place and service, drinks are good and food delicious excellent view the where getting close frequently to check if we where good and need something. (Trip advisor requiring 200 characters for this review however is less pleasing.) Luca and Ricardo were the best and extremely helpful, always with a huge smile on their faces :) thank you guys so much, we‚Äôll be back again soon!. Ricardo and his team in beach service are exemplary, Dalton at front desk jumped into action, everyone at Lolos was kind and helpful.. Ricardo & team on the beach were so personable - they remembered key details about our party and always took great care of us.. The poolside service was amazing and Junie always made sure our needs were met (and our drinks were topped off).. I love the staff here.. Friendly service with good drinks.. Good food in restaurants with beach service during the day.. Ronnie was super helpful and friendly as well as the other staff!. Really appreciate the customer service and hospitality.. Chairs are comfy, day beds are large and service is great.. Ricardo, Cedric  and Ronnie on the beach staff are true professionals & fully grasp the  meaning of customer care!. Rooms were good, customer service was excellent, and we enjoyed the Mexican restaurant downstairs.. I loved the service from the entire Marriott.. Good service, nice professional!. Amazing service, really made our trip!. I arrived 3-15 and well greeted by Bell Hop Services to take our belonging to our rooms.. Beach service was superb.. The hotel service seems to be understaffed for our state.. But the beach attendants were exceptional and the beach service was adequate.. Caryn at the front desk was a delight and very helpful.. Across the walkway is a stretch of some of the best beach in Miami with hotel beach attendants and food and beverage service.. Service is above average and everyone is friendly and ready to assist.. Both were extremely helpful when setting up our beach chairs and serving drinks.. Excellent customer service, will definitely be coming back here again. Bar and restaurant service extremely slow.. Starbucks attached to hotel always had something missing, one time couldn‚Äôt heat up anything so no breakfast sandwiches available , another time missing a bunch of ingredients for certain drinks, line up super long and staff was unfriendly.. 18% gratuity already on tab for everything you get yet service is terrible.. Thank you, Ronnie, for excellent customer service.. So accommodating and Ronnie was just the best‚ù§Ô∏è All of the staff especially Brittany at the front desk made our stay so enjoyable!. Kristina at the front desk was welcoming and very helpful, a true joy to interact with.. So polite and helpful with everything we needed!. All staff were helpful.. Beach staff set you up with towels, chairs, umbrellas, food, etc.. Cleaning staff gave extra supplies as needed.. Great service, Ronnie was truly exceptional and went above and beyond for us.. Beach and beach staff are excellent.. The downfalls : Front desk staff not always friendly .. Wanted to change our room because it was tiny, across from elevator and looked out onto a wall, got the run around from front desk staff who suggested I switch rooms with one of my children as this would be easier for us and them.. The beach staff is excellent !. Each room includes 2 beach chairs daily but you have to pay for an umbrella , which is ironic because the beach staff set up a row of umbrellas to line the hotel property and local beach goers ‚Äúsquat‚Ä?under the umbrellas for free while hotel guests pay for their umbrellas.. I been here with a friend of mine  to have a relaxing day , when we get here the guys where so friendly to us and help us to decide the place and the best view  for me is 5 star on everything i love the place and service, drinks are good and food delicious excellent view the where getting close frequently to check if we where good and need something. The hotel grounds and staff are very polite and friendly.The location of the hotel was perfect.. Good location, friendly staff.

I picked this hotel depending on the good reviews.. After reading the reviews, I had planned to request a room facing Ocean Ave, but with the outage we were just happy to get any convenient room.. When we entered the room, there was no view.. The view from the room was perfect for anybody wanting to watch the action on Ocean Drive.. Our room was lovely and we had views of the ocean.. The view was GORGEOUS!. Couple of cons: If you want a view, forget it.. And my ""corner"" room came with a patio, but the view was of the AC unit for the building next door along with a dirty, noisy alleyway below.. I don't leave reviews for hotels often, but I felt the need to point out how great the staff were at this location.. We had a small balcony with a partial view of the ocean.. There is a wonderful rooftop patios area with seats and other chairs where u can get an ocean view and unwind after a night out.

I don't leave reviews for hotels often, but I felt the need to point out how great the staff were at this location.. Please note that Ocean Drive is closed to cars, so valet and luggage services are about a block away, and they do a great job of communicating these options to you before hand..

This hotel offers a range from $227 - $398 per night and is ranked #53 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 202 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: We read the reviews and knew going in they would be small but it was smaller than I expected especially without a closet.. The rooftop pool and bar were a highlight, offering stunning views of the ocean and city skyline.. Nice sized pool with lots of sun and nice views from the rooftop.. Con: We booked a city view but got the concrete wall view instead.. The roof deck is huge with multiple seating areas and a plunge pool -- all with ocean views on one side and bay/sunset views on the other.. The room was very small with view of the alley.. The roof top was nice with a great view with plenty of places to relax.. Fantastic rooftop views and right in the middle of everything‚Ä¶all within walking distance.. Went onto the roof at night and during the early morning just to see the view and it was very cool.. I and my wife - who used to work for Starwood‚Äôs Preferred Guest rewards program including mystery shopping hotel brands - 100 percent agree with the other negative reviews on this property.. It offers an amazing roof top which was our favorite to catch the sunset with 360 view of the city! Very clean, comfortable beds, very modern, great staff.. The hotel and the staff ate awsome.. The front desk the bellman the lady at the pool and bar staff were all grrat.. Fun space, fun environment, clean, great staff, accommodating and everything.. I noticed how the staff dealt with conflict and respect their honesty and assertiveness while still being accommodating which isn't always an easy thing to do in hospitality.. was helpful during our stay of celebrating.. It‚Äôs a great hotel and all the staff were so friendly and helpful.. Friendly staff and we were able to get an early check-in.. We did find the staff to all be incredibly nice and helpful.. The staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating, and the amenities were top-notch.. South Beach does not live up to the definition of hospitality.. I‚Äôve worked in hospitality for twenty years, and the lack of professionalism and guest SERVICE  is a slap in the face of the greats of hospitality like Bill Marriott.. The hotel is making the most of it and the staff is kind, so have fun and enjoy your time.. Staff was friendly and always available.. Yes the room was a little small and we made it work...clever ""closet"", fluffy towels, great staff, affordable valet service and comp coffee at 7am with a nice coffee shop and bar were appreciated.. The staff was very friendly and the location was perfect.. Lovely staff, beautiful decoration, free bike, perfect location, beautiful pool and rooftop and they even managed a last minute room decoration for my daughter‚Äôs birthday.. Friendly staff, cool modern place, clean, comfortable beds.. Staff was friendly and the restaurant attached to the second floor was spot on, both in food quality and ambiance.. 1) Location - Right in the heart of South Beach walking distance to the beach , shops, restaurants, everything , I found a great boot camp studio only two blocks a way and went there every day 2) Great pool and restaurants 3) Staff were wonderful - The manager of the hotel (Leslie) go us a great upgrade!. The staff were great especially Franco, who made our stay very special and advised us about what to do around south Beach!. I was blown away by their hospitality in making me feel like a royal guest at the Moxy.. I hope they get major kudos from their managers for their excellent customer service!. Wonderful, friendly staff with great dining and pool options.. But, I can forgive that, as the hotel and staff are FIRE üî•!!. Location is great and the staff was very friendly.. This is a $700/night hotel with cartoonishly  small rooms and a front desk staff and manager that seem more interested in projecting a cool, hip vibe  then treating their guests with courtesy and kindness.. If you are a Marriott member accustomed to how other Marriott brands - including the ‚ÄúTrendy  bit still does service right W‚Ä?- does things - BEWARE!. I would highly recommend for location and customer service.

Beautiful hotel.. From customer service to the rooms, location, views and everything in between.. My friends and I stayed here for our reunion and I agree with all the previous reviews that the service is amazing.. This room has an ocean view but no balcony and it is a little bigger than the room that I booked.. Lunch review below‚Ä?
BEACH: Direct, easy access.. Delicious restaurant with pool view, awesome beach. The whole team on the beach is awesome Isaac will and Troy give the best service on the beach.. They know everybody‚Äôs name take good care of you and make sure your head is in the shade.. üòâ love the Nautilis hotel, and the team on the beach 
Let‚Äôs not forget Alexis, concierge extra ordinaire who made her stay extra special... I‚Äôve traveled a lot and the service Oscar provides is 5 star, that‚Äôs the vibe I want when I‚Äôm on vacation!. Oscar and Alexis treated us so warmly and were extremely helpful all week.. Isaac at the beach is a gem who also took great care of us.. Staff cares and goes above and beyond to make sure you‚Äôre having the best time and experience.. From the front desk staff, to the valet staff and the servers.. We were accommodated by Oscar who was nothing but helpful.. The wait staff Ariana, Lana, Lucy, Belen, and Giulia were absolutely amazing and helpful.. 10/10 Jackie as well‚Ä?great service for my entire stay.. Nautilus staff is incredibly accommodating.. Oscar, Jordan, Alexis, Issac, and Yusef are all beautiful people and took great care of us during our week long stay.. The customer service at Nautilus is top notch!. We‚Äôve never experienced service at this level.. Oscar, Jordan, Izak, Alexis,  Lana provided the best service ever.. Best service the front staff (Oscar) and the pool staff (Jordan&alexis&lucila) were so gracious to us.. Every staff member is exceptionally helpful and attentive.. We really appreciated the service.. Big Thanks to the wonderful staff of Arlo Nautilus for making our 20th Anniversary stay memorable!. Big shout outs to the extraordinary, amazing pool staff Jordan and Svetlana!. The staff is super friendly, incredibly helpful and are doing their best to make sure you have a great time.. Staff is excellent , hotel is well maintained and love the pool.. Spent most of time at the beach , loved the staff there too!. She took such great care of me I will come back to the hotel just for her as she‚Äôs that good.. Buffet breakfast at this hotel was 33 UDS pkus service charge of 14% and then tax of course.. Good service.. Thank you so much for all your hard work üòì 
I am very happy with that service especially for Isaac , omg he remembers all tourist name 
He is amazing with his customer service skills ü§©also Wilkelnson , he did find my cell that I lost on the beach 
Thank you üôèüèº. It has a nice vibe at the pool and helpful and friendly staff.. AJ took extra care and homework was done in advance to make sure I felt welcome.. I would definitely come back here, the staff is so superb.. I have to give a shout out to Wilkenson from the beach staff.. Great customer service!. From the moment I arrived there was a smile on every staff members face.. Staff was excellent at the pool, the beach, the restaurant,etc.. Some of the best service I‚Äôve ever had, extremely nice person and made me feel valued.. Isaac and Belen
Provided the beast beach side service.. The staff could not have been kinder and they made a very stressful situation a lot better.. | specifically want to thank pool/ cabana staff.. They took care of us for the day at the pool, and made the experience special.. Super clean and extremely friendly staff.. We checked into the hotel and we‚Äôre immediately greeted with the best hospitality, expediting our room availability and setting us up at the pool.. Everyone was so helpful and kind, making our weekend amazing.. The nautilus beach team was really helpful, wil took great care of us and the the hotel was amazing.t the food was great and can‚Äôt wait to come back.. Oscar was especially helpful and showed us several different room options so we could have our dream pick!. The amazing hospitality showed by Oscar and melody warmed my heart.. From customer service to the rooms, location, views and everything in between.. Special shout out to the valet manager Rolson St. Louis, Front desk attendant Alvin, front door attendant Abel  and server Edwin at the Cabana Club for their positive attitude, continuous smile, and exemplary customer service!. My friends and I stayed here for our reunion and I agree with all the previous reviews that the service is amazing.. I do admit that I removed some of the items in the mini fridge to make room for some of the things I purchased from CVS but everything I removed was carefully placed on the side of the minibar.. The front desk staff was super responsive and helped us find a more family friendly atmosphere down the beach!. STAFF: Helpful, warm, five-star service.. Oscar, Lana, Arianna, Melody, Tea, Giuliano, and Jackie take pride in this retro boutique hotel and provided world-class service.. The water was the perfect temperature, crystal clear, not crowded, tranquil, quality guests and very polished staff.. I‚Äôm sure this would be especially helpful at times when it‚Äôs near capacity - no awkward weaving through the chairs and scooting them around to fit your group.. Svetlana took excellent care of us and anticipated our every need.. We were married at Four Seasons The Biltmore Santa Barbara and the service level at Nautilus was beyond any Four Seasons we‚Äôve stayed at.. I would just improve the cleanliness of windows and elevators + the elevators are extremely slow ;) The staff is really helpful, though.. From the rooms to the front desk staff to the pool staff, everything was perfect.. The pool staff, Eva, Belen, Arianna and Jackie were so kind.

Nobu Hotel Miami Beach,"Nobu Hotel Miami Beach is a hotel rated 4.0 stars, located at 4525 Collins Ave, Miami Beach, FL 33140-3226. This hotel offers a range from $339 - $593 per night and is ranked #102 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 206 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: Between the facilities and the room this hotel was super clean and had incredible views.. The issues listed in this review may not seem like a big deal for most people, and they were not a big deal to us, but as a labeled 5 star hotel, these things matter.. We were not given a tour or even an overview of the resort.. We reviewed our check in as we were emailed to do within the first 24 hours of stay, and no one from management reached out to us.. Hotel location and staff were nice, you are right on the beach, the view is to die for.. Our room had an incredible view, but the bathroom only had 1 tiny sink with very little space to put my things and the shower was also tiny.. And one morning for an unknown reason we weren‚Äôt able to eat at the ocean view restaurant.. I feel a bit weird splashing this out on the internet for complete strangers to read, but it‚Äôs relevant to this review‚Ä?. I wish I had a better ocean view.. They upgraded us (without asking) to an amazing room with gorgeous ocean view on the eleventh floor.. Upon reviewing my emailed receipt, this was essentially a lie.. You see the view from you open the door.. The view from my balcony was amazing.. The view was amazing.. Great location and beautiful ocean view Suite, with beautiful view and great amenities in the suite.. I‚Äôm not one to ever leave reviews EVER, but a place like this with amazing people like Sabrina in the front desk?. I travel a lot and I‚Äôve never gone out of my way to write a bad review for a hotel and this is my first time.. Ocean views from my room are spectacular. The Nobu was great, Gaby went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of every day.. I will be back,  thank for taking such great care of us.. The front desk staff was attentive and accommodating.. I would highly recommend planning a special event at this beautiful property with the help of people who really care about their guests and their experience. The staff was very helpful everywhere.. Location good, services good, near beach.. We were treated with no respect, the staff is aggressive and unhelpful.. You pay more but you get real service and amazing experience.. Dirty, sticky tables in restaurant, lack of customer service.. Luckily, hotel staffed accommodated us and switched them to a main floor room which was more like a suite!. Pool service was terrible.. Having traveled to thousands of hotels in my lifetime, I am quite knowledgeable regarding the services provided by 5 star hotel, and what qualities are necessary for that label.. When you reach the hotel, several staff members will be there to open doors and direct arriving vehicles, but that‚Äôs about it.. None of these staff members helped us take our luggage out of the car, or carry it up the stairs into the lobby.. Bartenders at the ocean social bar and the other pool bar were not friendly and attentive despite the added service.. Staff here seems to be a bit flustered, it almost functions like the hotel opened last month.. The hotel was crowded and service was terrible, multiple phone calls to front desk, housekeeping, guest services all went unanswered.. Failed to deliver elevated service as the concierge service in ineffective.. Everything available to you and loved the staff and cleanliness of the whole facility.. Pool was clean and waiters were very helpful, quick and friendly.. Rooms are spacious, comfortable, bathrooms gorgeous, and staff was always helpful.. Hotel location and staff were nice, you are right on the beach, the view is to die for.. Service was fine most of the time even if sometimes a bit aloof.. Gaby, who works at the front desk was very helpful and I look forward to an amazing stay.. The staff was very hard working and pleasant across the board.. If you want to go to the worst hotel with the most horrible service in Miami you found the right place.. When we checked in, Sabrina took exceptionally great care of us.. I cannot say enough about the level of care and service she provided.. I was already a loyal Nobu Miami guest, but Sabrina‚Äôs extra attentive service on this particular trip has really cemented a special kind of love for this place.. I‚Äôve been fortunate to stay at some really nice hotels worldwide, but none of them have come close to this level of genuine hospitality.. I am truly grateful for the Nobu Miami, and particularly for Sabrina‚Äôs empathy and care.. I was called a few hours later to be informed that they were double booked and I couldn't be serviced by the spa manager Juilisa.. She didn't offer a different service, a different time, I explained that I leave at 7am the next day.. The staff is great, I will give them that, but the hotel charges hidden fees at every corner.. The front desk staff was great and very helpful!. I was also expecting some cute chocolate or mints for turndown service, but that didn‚Äôt happen.. The service was pretty good and they were pretty quick when it  came down to getting ice delivered, etc... Excellent room service.. The service at Nobu is unmatched period.. Everything was perfect from day one the staff is amazing.. When we arrived, we were greeted by the valet service, which was efficient, though not necessarily anything special or friendly.. The customer service felt customized and meticulous without being intrusive.. All of our interactions with the front desk staff were excellent.. Phone service is very poor.. Fortunately, we were able to go by the front desk and the staff there was always super helpful.. Eventually, they shared a text service they offer, and I would recommend using it for small service requests during your stay.. The pool was a little lightly staffed (one waitress for the whole Nobu Pool both days), and the hostess was a bit dishonest when discussing gratuities.. The room was beautiful, but there were stains on some of the furniture, though daily housekeeping was immaculate, and our interactions with housekeeping staff we always excellent.. The staff at the entire location was warm and welcoming making sure my stay was a good one.. From the moment we pulled up we were greeted  by valet who took care of us.. The staff was super helpful as well.. The staff was fantastic.. The service was top-notch from arrival to departure.. From the welcome gift in our villa to the service at our private poolside dinner, we couldn't have asked for a better experience.. Room service was great.. Food and beach service was spot on.. The personnel needs training and they need to care more.. Exceptional service across the board no matter what state you are in.. Although this is one of the best hotels that I have stayed in, it was the service that stood out.. Food at Nobu was very good-service very was very good, and front desk was helpful in transportation choices.. Certain things could be a little bit quicker, but Nobu Hotel staff does a great job overall!. I simply have no words to describe how welcoming and nice all the staff are.. Ambiance 10/10, cleaning services are 100/10 as well.. The cleaning staff is doing such an amazing job.. I traveled with my friends and nine out of 10 staff members at the hotel were rude inconsiderate, and most importantly, harassed us.. Horrible Service horrible food horrible stuff horrible experience.. The front desk does seem under staffed and was difficult to contact via telephone.. You can never say enough great things about the staff and how hard they work here.. Banquet staff was incredible from Moe, Isabella, Javier, Paolo.. They all work so incredibly hard to make sure our conference was well taken care off and we didn‚Äôt want for much of anything.. But the beautiful Miami weather made up for a lot - and the hospitality of the staff I mentioned make us come back year after year.

Speedy service, fun environment, great escape from the usual ocean drive crowd.. And also We loved the foods and service given to us during our Breakfast.. The staff, our king suite, the delicious upscale Italian food, and yes, the Aperol Spritzes were exceptional.. Thank you, Pelican staff for treating us like royalty!. The staff and owners were friendly and accommodating, the rooms all had their own theme and were perfectly cleaned, and the scent in this hotel is just amazing.. The best part by far was the amazing customer service which is hard to find in South Beach!. One disappointment though was the lack of hospitality.. Previously, staff had always been welcoming, this time this was lacking.. Just a shame the staff couldn‚Äôt crack a smile and be more welcoming.. Excellent style and decor; fabulous staff.. The hotel, in part because of the staff but also because of the Deisel design, has a very European (Italian, specifically) feel to it.. Close to many bike rentals and staff had excellent recommendations for local restaurants (in addition to their own).. Again, excellent staff and we appreciated our stay.. Great Hotel, Top Location and Fantastic staff and kind service.. The beach service and towels are good and the nightlife around it make it quite unique.. Owners as well as all the employees are extremely kind and helpful and I would absolutely say a special thank you to Anthony, the receptionist.. Services included are amazing and it does not take long until you feel a special guest : free towels for the beach, spot on the beach where you can get a sunbed, the room being checked in the evening and a card with the weather forecast put on the bed with a little something.. Everything a hotel should be...great location, service, deco and food.. The staff was delightful and helpful.. Great location, very friendly and helpful staff, clean rooms, pleasant smell throughout the property.. Lovely staff; especially the guy with glasses at the reception .. he was very helpful.. I requested a room change as my son was scared of a wall ornament and they were totally cool with it.. Anthony and Lawrence at the check in desk was very, polite and helpful.. The entire staff was so friendly and helpful during our stay.. Wendell was very helpful in suggesting just the right room for us.. Front desk staff and valet were friendly and accommodating.. Service, bar and restaurant were all amazing.. Staff at the frontdesk were very helpful, Justin the bartender is a great dude with quite the knowledge of Miami and drinks.. Impeccable service.. Awesome cafe restaurant food is fabulous service attentive can't say enough about The Pelican.. The hotel is done with a lot of love - and this comes to the incredible staff.. They are simply amazing - so excited about this new adventure, so helpful, so friendly.. thank you to the staff for making our stay memorable..

The hotel was exactly as described and the service was amazing..

It has service agreements with other hotels and restaurants.. Very clean, super well located, attention very nice, David at the reception very nice and welcoming as well as the rest of the staff.. The rest of the staff seems to be missing some training!. Thank you to David and the other awesome staff here, you guys are doing great work!. Our house David accommodated us while we waited, was very polite, and just super friendly and helpful.. On our beach day David went above and beyond in taking care of us..

This hotel offers a range from $43 - $104 per night and is ranked #1 of 206 Specialty lodging in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 58 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: We were also forced to write a review on our last day and the staff member was looking as we wrote it.. Very strange, it felt very forced which is why they probably have good reviews.. Can you believe they purchased it for her to avoid a bad review and they left none for the hostel/guests?. By the review she gave me about the place makes me want to come and stay here!!. This was my first time staying in a hostel, but had read enough reviews I knew what to expect.. I was a little concerned because so read a lot of reviews in different sites(booking, google maps, and here that were a little rough but I didn‚Äôt have anything to worry about.. No forks,spoons,bowls,cups,and only one knife for that matter....
   That‚Äôs about it... 
   PS: In the lobby of the hotel they have happy hours for the drinks based on tips only(and let me give you a good advice on that..,the better you tip the bartender,the better during you going to get,so don‚Äôt be cheap...))) The drinks are very good,as well as the food in the restaurant downstairs at the lobby of the hotel, where they have a cozy set up of tables and chairs inside and outside of the premises with great views of Collins Avenue... it was really good experience for me it was my first time stayed in hostel.it was very clean pool there are so nice people and very friendly workers that so helpful.especially rina she is really love with her job she was so cute thanks for everything i hope next year i will be in same hostel.thank you Rina.. Excellent hostel,staff were great especially Rina who was always helpful beautiful well maintained pool and facilities were well maintained .. The staff were also very courteous and would try there best to help in any way they could.. The service is definitely on a top tier level üíéüôå. The first impression was good; unlike other hostels I've stayed at both in Miami Beach and elsewhere, Posh has professional, paid staff instead of random ""volunteers"" who only get compensated with room and board.. It appears that Posh is affiliated with nearby hotels like Whitelaw and shares staff with them.. Special shoutout to Angel who checked us in and took care of us during our 3 week stay.. We came in late at night and usually, overnight staff are tired and grumpy, but Angel was upbeat and friendly and put us in a good spot when we said we wanted to avoid foot traffic and noise.. The staff and people in the hostel were friendly but you have no privacy whatsoever.. We were also forced to write a review on our last day and the staff member was looking as we wrote it.. You always meet nice people and the staff is amazing‚Ä¶specially Rina!.  Great customer service by angel and Rina.. Staff always helpful!. She was friendly and very helpful, going out of her way to find me the best bed available, checking me out early etc.. Not only is it a block from the beach but has such friendly staff and beautiful facilities!. Katherine was helpful in helping us with our.. The staff are good people, and Katherine was especially sweet.. It's good for what you pay

Pros: beds and sheets are clean, bathrooms are clean and stocked with soap and supplies, towels at your disposal, nice-ish hangout area at the top, the staff are pretty nice, especially Katherine she was cool, and the manager Lee was also nice even tho I didn't have the best check-in experience

Cons: the pool was closed when we were there, there aren't dedicated sockets or lamps for each bed, little privacy in the showers. The staff members were kind, caring and helped with anything one might need.. Excellent service.. The staff was awesome, they treated me like a family member.. The staff cleans everything at least once a day.. The receptionists are all very friendly and helpful with whatever you need!. The staff was very kind and helpful, specially Elena the Italian lady is very polite.. She made my entire stay of 3 weeks such a great experience just by how helpful and kind she was to me as a female solo traveler.. I really appreciate this chain for providing quality services, staff and amenities for such an affordable price.. And Anita for helping taking care of the area.. The staff were lovely and the location was perfect!. The staff was really polite and helpful.. + comfortable beds and nice bathrooms 
- no real cooking or food storage possibilities, all kitchen appliances are either broken or nonexistent 
- the concept of ‚Äòcreating a good hostel vibe‚Ä?is lost on the staff, it‚Äôs more of an army campground vibe.. Posh is what you make it.Fellow travelers are so friendly.Travelers share their life experiences,work.family,there goals in life.I'm a senior citizen,more young than old at Posh,but i didn't feel out of place.The staff is available for questions and info..This is the first time at a hostel.Solo traveler who never felt alone.This is the best benefit at Posh.Bring sandals for the shower.The staff is on their toes cleaning throughout the day.Good food like a  chicken bob,pizza,tacos,all within walking distance.. He went ABOVE and BEYOND his hospitality‚Äôs Joshua was always caring and really empathetic.. The staff are amazing (Josh and Alex here's looking at you), the cleaners are efficient, the layout is well thought out, the beds are super comfy - but most importantly, THE GUESTS ARE AMAZING.. Staff were above and beyond excellent, ps, the maid does an awesome job, Alex was the best manager I've ever seen, give him a raise.. The place is clean, the beds are comfortable and the staff is kind and helpful.. He provides truly a five star service.. The staff cleans the premises on daily bases,but unfortunately some people don‚Äôt have common sense and are piggy enough not clean after themselves,which creates a bit of a mess from time to time.. The staff was always attentive and caring.. It‚Äôs true they would solve it by just asking at the reception but I think it‚Äôs obvious we wouldn‚Äôt have to go ask for it and it should be taken care of by default.. The interior could use a few updates, especially the bathrooms, but the whole place was cleaned daily and the front desk staff was excellent.. Staff was amazing and the facility is beautiful.

Red South Beach Hotel,"Red South Beach Hotel is a hotel rated 4.0 stars, located at 3010 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33140-4107. This hotel offers a range from $123 - $235 per night and is ranked #108 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 100 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: I read the reviews before booking but ignored the warnings because I wanted to save money.. I was very nervous about going to this hotel after reading all the reviews.. Thankfully, I didn't read the reviews prior to reserving the room!. Following this Tripadvisor review, I will be sending an email to our cruise company, advising them never to send any more customers to this dreadful ‚Äúhotel‚Ä?. For the sake of a fair review I‚Äôll make sure to list the positives!. I'm not sure if the other reviews are genuine because this hotel is truly awful and the worst place we have ever stayed. It was good and the customer service was great her name was lourdes she was very helpful!. Everyone of the staff members I‚Äôve encountered were very pleasant but this one particular Front Desk receptionist by the name of ‚ÄúLourdes‚Ä?was the absolute BEST thus far.. I am absolutely grateful for her &  because of her excellent customer service skills I would most definitely return to the facility & recommend mi familia & friends.. I would like to mention some names from people that really take care of the guest like Mike from restaurant and Mr Eugenio .We probably come back soon We stronger recommend the place it is adorable. She was so nice and helpful for everything.. Especially the receptionist Lordes was very helpful and really nice.. Thank you for being so helpful!. Thats all i can sayüòÖ single men, women, just stood in the hall ways, just stood, no idea what they were on?, but it was not happy pills, plus theres a 50 dollor service charge for wifi and pool, it says on here its free, its not.. All staff were very kind and accommodating.. They had no solution to take care of this.. Apparently there was no maintenance and staff at night.. The guys on the beach take card which was helpful)
- Lourdes in Reception helped us out when we asked to move rooms and she seemed to sympathise with our complaints.. We‚Äôre absolutely gutted about this and asked every day for help checking cctv/speaking to cleaning staff and security etc and not a single member of staff was interested in helping us 
- A very loud air con unit in our first room - too noisy so had to turn it off at night which meant sleeping in a very hot room!. Sadly, staff seemed to be quite stressed by this and we witnessed staff snapping/shouting at other guests who were making reasonable requests/complaints.. Front desk staff Lavdes was awesome that‚Äôs why I gave three stars.. And the hotel is really good for the price, the bathrooms is nice too also Lourdes is so helpful and sweet and the hotel is on Miami Beach it‚Äôs lit. The only positive thing I can say is that the guess service people were very nice.. Our trip was a success although maintenance didn‚Äôt do their best in security the front desk staff Lourdes was very supportive and thorough when making a note for management.. He really gave the best customer service anyone could ask for.. She is friendly, helpful, easily available,  and assisted us with all our needs, without any problem.. She was friendly, helpful and assisted us with all our needs‚Ä?we will be returning to south beach and will look forward to staying at The Red  Hotel Thanks Lourdes for making this visit memorable.. 11/10 customer service.. I had a little issue with the AC from my room, but Mr Eugenio take care of it really quick, he was so attentive.. Excellent customer service and very friendly staff.. The staff was pleasant, and the location was great,  Bus went right by the front door,  Beach was a short walk across the street.. We arrived at the hotel and we found everything very clean, we went to the room and everything was very nice, the towels, the sheets very clean, the attention of the cleaning staff was excellent, we want to highlight the attention of the Cleaning Manager Eugenio, very professional and at all times very attentive to everything thanks we recommend it and we will return. And behind the desk is beautiful, helpful girls.. Not so beautiful, but very helpful indeed.. The free Trolley service round the corner and the beach 100 yards away.. On top of that, there is a notice that ""due to the pandemic"" there will only be maid service if you ask for it.. Funny, no maid service is the only pandemic protecol in effect.. We had an issue with the room and the personnel was very attentive and professional Mr Eugenio was very responsible, he really shows hospitality.. I would like mention also about the professional service from front desk.. I had to demand some
Sort of compensation because the staff could care less.. She was very helpful and nice.. Horacio told us everything we needed to know about hotel services, beach equipment, late breakfast and our room.. We could tell that a lot of little touches throughout show that management/ownership really does care about the guests overall positive experience with this property.. Just returned from this hotel after my second visit it is a really lovely clean hotel staff are friendly and helpful and go the extra mile especially horacio who went over and above after I suddenly lost my husband whilst away also like to mention Sofia would go back in a heartbeat. I appreciate the staff at this hotel, they are all so nice! For more information, visit https://redsouthbeach.com/ or check reviews online to learn more about guest experiences."
SLS South Beach,"SLS South Beach is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 1701 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33139-2006. This hotel offers a range from $258 - $527 per night and is ranked #45 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 140 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: The hotel amenities have stunning views.. We had Premier Ocean View, beautifully decorated and glam.. a room with city view means you get the light against the building all night.. Booked an ocean view king room, but was pleasantly upgraded to a villa.. Bathroom is super small ‚Ä?even in Deluxe King with Ocean View.. Rooms (Premier Ocean View Double) super small, definitely not fait selling these rooms for 2 adults and 2 children.. They upgraded us to a higher floor with an ocean view which was nice.. The rooms, though ocean view, also come with a view of the rather ugly tops of the buildings in front and of the parking lot.. I could hardly wait to get home to write this review on the RIP OFF experience we had at this hotel.. We were offered an ""upgrade"" to a pool view villa and after negotiating for the hotel to throw in a free breakfast, free valet, and waiving the resort fee, we were taken to our villa room.. We were shown a third room with an ocean view, but the beds seem to have been made for very small people and the room size matched the beds.. The location is wonderful, rooms are small as others have stated but we expected it based on reviews.. We woke up every morning to our ocean view, which was worth every penny.. Favorite - olives, tomato/watermelon skewers, Neptune‚Äôs pillow, bacalao, I can‚Äôt believe they require 200 characters to publish a review, It‚Äôs not dinner. Leila provided exceptional service, going above and beyond to ensure I had a comfortable and enjoyable stay.. The staff go above and beyond ‚Ä?huge thank you to Nick and LaDonna at the pool, Paola and Cierra at the beach!. Food was delicious and service staff were excellent.. Beach and pool service was top notch as well.. Hotel staff was great.. Pool staff service was on point...shout out to Izabelle and Kris!!!. The common hallways were even more unkempt and shabby, and one of the elevators was inoperable while the remaining elevator was cluttered with dirty dishes and cups from room service and so everyone had to cram in to avoid stepping on the dishes.. Furthermore, I observed the housekeeping staff congregating outside our room for 45 minutes and when I asked them what they were doing they explained that they were basically hiding and waiting for their shift to end,  Despite the kind efforts of the manager and front desk staff, it was clear that the housekeeping and maintenance issues were pervasive.. While I appreciate the efforts of the manager and front desk staff, the housekeeping and maintenance issues were too significant to ignore.. We enjoyed her poolside and not only did she offer great service, she did it with a smile and a personality that makes you want to come back again!!!. staff is very nice and pleasant.. Yane is everything - best service ever - magic.. The food on site is quite solid but pricey and the service is slow (but isn't that everywhere post-pandemic, when you're short on staff).. The local valet service was useful to go a couple of miles down the block for dinner drop off.. Staff were excellent, from arrival and taking the car, wait staff, bell hop.. Used their car service one evening to go to south beach, which was very handy.. Their staff is amazing truly going above and beyond for their guests.. Very patronizing staff.. You see, there is no service elevator, so this one elevator has to serve 12 floors of rooms, and the basement, and all the cleaners and facilities and kitchen.. The staff are friendly, the location is nice, the pool is great.. Level of service terrible for such hotel especially for breakfast.. Beach services awful, not even existing.. Good mention though to restaurants services and food in the evenning, both Katsuya and Bazaars.. wonderful staff.. The entire staff was great,  however one individual was Outstanding.. He was on top of everything, walking around the bar , restaurant,  pool and ensuring all the guests were taken care of.. I would rate Nefs style of management and his hospitality skills second to none.. Felt very comfortable and safe, amazing service and amazing atmosphere.. Service was beyond incredible, would definitely return.. 10/10 for all services, music, hospitality and atmosphere.. I‚Äôm all about people making money‚Ä?But when you don‚Äôt have enough chairs for even your guests, I think you should prioritize your guests first‚Ä?
 That night I went to talk to the front desk and I was greeted by a very rude man who rudely took a piece of paper with their terms of service and highlighted that everything was FIRST COME FIRST SERVE.. Staff is rude.. Great vibe and superb service.. The staff were friendly and helpful, the location was great, and the food was fantastic.. Our stay was superb - Peter was the best ambassador, helpful and friendly throughout our stay.. The reception crew were also very helpful both before and during our stay, making our break a lovely memory!. The staff [when you can find them] are rude and the vibe is pertinacious - the hotel wants to be hip and cool, but could benefit from working on some of the very basics like clean towels and friendly service.. It was an absolute delightful entry in part to the decor, however Peter made sure we were set in our room and continued to amaze us with his expertise and hospitality.. Hotel Ambassador Peter E. took exceptional care in making sure my stay was top notch.. The guests at our dinner event were absolutely amazed by the great food and service at the Bazaar, SLS South Beach.. We‚Äôve received number of feedback notes especially with regard to the quality of the food and its presentation with instructions by the wait staff.. Super helpful and always on point.. He couldn‚Äôt be more helpful (even though we were only day guests) and took our bags, checked us in and explained where the facilities were.. Fantastic staff, fantastic location, but a couple of things to watch out for.... Staff were friendly, engaging, and very willing to help in any way - could not have been nicer.. Again staff couldn't have been more accommodating in getting us moved, but not really cool to have to do a room change at midnight.. The hotel, food, staff, and pool were fantastic.. The staff is very friendly, nice and helpful.. Hotel staff are helpful and friendly, especially Peter Erasme, the hotel's Ambassador.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: To be honest, we picked it because it had less bad reviews than their competitors.. The hotel was clean, our room had a pretty ocean view, the staff was friendly and accommodating, the beach and pool were wonderful, the pool/beach staff were very helpful and genuine.. We had a garden view room overlooking the pool which was really nice.. All-suites, fantastic views of the garden, the pool, and the ocean.. We were pleased with the room and our balcony view.. We just returned from a four-night stay at The Sagamore, and contrary to having some reservations based on reading previous reviews, our family just did not have as great of an experience as usual at other nearby properties.. I want to preface this review by saying by and large, the staff here were some of the friendliest I've ever seen in 9 years of going to Miami for trips, ESPECIALLY the bellhops who couldn't have been more amazing (always opening the door, greeting us, being pro-active about getting our bas, being sweet to our son....A+++ to them!).. I know most people don't care about TV when on vacation, but our unique jobs make some viewing a necessity. Beautiful beach front property with an amazing staff and great amenities.. The folks at the front desk regardless of who‚Äôs there are always polite, helpful and ready to help where they can.. He too is ALWAYS smiling, helpful and will do what he can to make your Beach experience wonderful.. He was very helpful and nice..

Amazing luxury place 10 stars for sure. The front desk was very helpful and always greeted us with a smile on their face.. Position is the best , service also are nice and in beach is very nice to stay.. The staff are nice and professional , I will come next year for sure in same period. Staff was attentive an made sure our stay was great.. Barista staff was very friendly.. We booked a bit late and maybe i missed it somewhere but it would be helpful if that was listed on the 'events'.. Affordable, clean, convenient, spacious, but most of all, the courteous staff made all the difference!. From the time we got there, the valet service, the guys at the door taking up our luggages, the front desk personnel.. the room service, pool service and kitchen service, I mean everyone of the staff members made this a great experience for my family and I. I would absolutely recommend Sagamore, especially family friendly... The staff is incredible.. The Hotel was clean, and the staff was friendly!. Blessed to have had such an amazing talent at our service.. Hotel is located in prime location Extremely clean place friendly staff.i love this hotel can't wait until next time.. Enjoyed our balcony room; very comfortable; accommodating and friendly staff.. Thank you for your hospitality!. I recommend this hotel nice location right on South Beach clean rooms front desk was amazing professional quick check in the whole staff was friendly valet, was nice and friendly nice respond time getting your vehicle. Wonderful property, wonderful staff, amazing experience.. Cant say enough about the staff and how attentive they were to our every need. The hotel was clean, our room had a pretty ocean view, the staff was friendly and accommodating, the beach and pool were wonderful, the pool/beach staff were very helpful and genuine.. The staff was very attentive and pleasant.. Great location, service and overall great hotel!. Every single person on the staff, from front desk to pool bar to housekeeping, was helpful, friendly and efficient.. The staff is friendly, helpful, available.. Beach staff and management were terrible.. Staff isn‚Äôt empowered to make any positive decisions.. The service was great and everyone was attentive to our needs.. We love staying at the Sagamore for the location, staff, rooms and overall experience.. Great location and great service overall.. Rooms are fantastic with high ceilings giving you the feeling of living large, staffs are very courteous, and pool activities are energizing during the day.. The entire staff is very friendly, from the restaurant servers to the hospitality clerks, house keeping, and valet.. Would love if the TV's could access netflix and other streaming service, but that really is my only complaint.. The place is not worth what they charge unless you don‚Äôt care anything about the inside of the hotel.. The staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and it smells heavenly!. Front desk and bell hop people were nice and helpful as can be.. The staff was alll so friendly and accomodating.. Staff was friendly and very accommodating.. But best of all -- and the key to truly making our stay a restful delight -- was the incomparably upbeat, kind, and keenly attentive staff, including bartender Vito (what a sweetheart!). I want to preface this review by saying by and large, the staff here were some of the friendliest I've ever seen in 9 years of going to Miami for trips, ESPECIALLY the bellhops who couldn't have been more amazing (always opening the door, greeting us, being pro-active about getting our bas, being sweet to our son....A+++ to them!).. In 2023, there is no reason to have such spotty service.. I know most people don't care about TV when on vacation, but our unique jobs make some viewing a necessity.. Beach service was great.. Delroy is always so helpful!!. The staff was wonderful- super attentive and very professional.. From the cleaning people to the front desk to the staff at the pool- everyone was superb.. Eugenia was very sweet to our son and super helpful! For more information, visit https://www.sagamoresouthbeach.com/ or check reviews online to learn more about guest experiences."

This hotel offers a range from $692 - $1,231 per night and is ranked #15 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 140 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: No real view but it didn‚Äôt matter.. Beautiful sleek, elegant room in the Art Deco block, with a large balcony with sea view, separate little sitting area and bath in the bedroom.. Extremely loud music at dinner in Jaya meant we couldn‚Äôt have a conversation so had to move inside, which again was a shame, though by chance we had a good view of the live show which we hadn‚Äôt been expecting!. I‚Äôve read reviews that mention the noise from music at the restaurant at night- yes, this is true, but it is the Miami night scene after all and none of us had a problem sleeping with it in the background.. Dark wood interior romantic and dramatic, spacious rooms, Violin at the afternoon, Evening show in Joya restaurant, clean beach large sunbeds, lunch at Ocean grill with ocean view, and Valmont Spa, best massage I ever had!. The Setai Towers - luxury stay 
Corner suite with panoramic views of the ocean.. Food was wonderful and views at sunset great.. The reviewer must have been drunk the entire time.. Everything else was simply amazing the check in service, the suite, the view, the welcome drink and fruit, the spa, the pools, the beach bar, the beach, breakfast, Sunday Jazz Brunch, everyone else!. I was upgraded to the Tower rooms and I had a ocenview suite which had good wow factor.. You got to like having a bathtub right in front of your bed, and the toilet and shower on opposite sides of the room if you are in the Art Deco building with a suite, and the ""partial ocean views"" are pretty awful compared to the Tower.. I liked having the northern view rather than the southern view.. We stayed in their ‚Äòcheapest‚Ä?room which was a city view suite. The main restaurant breakfast is excellent and staff is there for meeting any needs.. Service even better.. Amazing all around .. from the staff to the restaurant scenes to the accommodations.. Setai is a five star experience.. The service and staff are what take this hotel to the next level- they are friendly and helpful.. Starting with the A+ service to beautiful suites.. We love the amenities and the service.. The entire staff goes the extra mile with every request.. Beds are really comfortable and all people will take care of you as you are unique !. Great staff..

The service was absolutely excellent with very professional people doing a wonderful job.. Clean, comfortable, attentive service.. Food is delicious, pools and beach service is great.. Really nice facilities and spa as well - staff is super friendly and helpful and made us feel so at home.. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, always willing to go above and beyond to make sure your stay is perfect.. The service was very poor.. The Setai is unmatched for its high level of service, friendliness, and welcoming vibe.. Every single member of the staff is exceptional, from the housekeeper to the front desk to the concierge to the valet.. Amazing for a $ 1000+ room ‚Ä?. so don‚Äôt sleep in a courtyard room , 
Too bad because the staff is extremely friendly .. Beautiful hotel with terrific staff and service.. Great beach service.. The team and the service here is what sets this apart.. They all show their training with the presentation of your room key to the staff always helpful and on point.. However, the service from the front desk and the breakfast restaurant were awesome.. Amazing Staff , everybody polite , incredible food , drinks ... Acomodation.Spa , gym , Pools , 
You never want to lieve the hotel.. Everything was perfect 
Good service, always with a smile, it was a lot of fun, the most beautiful hotel in the world, we will definitely come back and recommend it,The rooms are clean, the security personnel are good and helpful, the waiters are always smiling and always asking if everything is okay, it was very fun to see that.. Either the staff smokes during work or the air conditioning system is interconnected with other rooms where people smoke.. The service/staff are on par with the world's best hotels, knowing your name instantly any remembering all of the details.. Restaurant/Bar food and service - in any location, from Jaya (go to the weekend dinner show),  to the pool (who doesn't want a kids menu chicken fingers?. Hotel/Beach towel and water service is great and everything feels first class.. Excellent Service, food, cleanliness.. Everything else was simply amazing the check in service, the suite, the view, the welcome drink and fruit, the spa, the pools, the beach bar, the beach, breakfast, Sunday Jazz Brunch, everyone else!. Incredible service and terrific attention to the little details.. Service, amenities & entertainment just to name a few.. Pool area (3 pools) was nice and service was attentive.. All staff very friendly.. Dining and breakfast food and service were very good.. Friendly and attentive staff - suite was well maintained and we enjoyed having access to multiple pools along with the beach.. The hotel, accomendations, amenities, staff and restaurants were amazing.. They clearly understand customer service and the attention to details.. This hotel is elegant, sophisticated and the services is exceptional.. Pool area is calm and zen during the day with beautiful palm trees, design elements and some of the nicest pool staff in the city.. The service was unmatched at the Setai..

Shelborne South Beach,"Shelborne South Beach is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 1801 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FL 33139-7414. This hotel offers a range from $246 - $399 per night and is ranked #54 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 200 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: Reading bad reviews made me nervous because at the time of booking, the hotel had solid ratings and price was not too outrages.. I am not sure who was upset and why these reviews were written but they are not accurate.. At the desk we were checked immediately and when I inquired on the upgrade we were offered a nice ocean view room on the high floor.. With an upgrade we got an ocean view with a balcony and enjoyed having a cup of coffee in the morning.. In some of the reviews I read about the construction site next door being unbearably loud, so yes there is a construction going on and some noise associated with it, but it was not distractive at all.. So our flight to London was cancelled and we needed a hotel for a night and this hotel looked great - sadly it was not the case
The room was nice and ocean view amazing but ‚Ä?the TV didn‚Äôt work , the fridge didn‚Äôt work , there were no pool towels available even  at 8am so couldn‚Äôt go for a swim, the room was beside the lift which was really noisy and the the best but there was dirty undies in one of the drawers when was looking for a hairdryer 

We were only there one night so there was no chance for the hotel to fix this but these are basics which should be right in the first place. We booked a partial ocean view room and received a concrete balcony with bushes so there was no view.. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever written a review of any establishment I‚Äôve stayed in but I am so annoyed at having to pay over $300 for a room with such sub standard facilities and poor service I felt I should let others know about this place .. FYI we stayed in room number 1509 .great view !. The view was beautiful and the room was incredibly comfortable.. Great view.. When I arrived at the hotel I was told to leave a 5 star review on trip advisor to be able to check in quicker, which was weird but I did it to not be stranded for 3 hours until check in time.. Review based on a one-night stay pre cruise and two nights post cruise.. We had booked a partial sea view room which turned out to be an accessible room on the 9th floor.. No apologies were given for their error or our inconvenience, no courtesy refreshments were offered but they appeared to make up for this by upgrading us to a sea view balcony room.. Despite the view of the sea the room again was very shabby and dirty. Staff didn‚Äôt really care about the property or the customers and it shows.. All the staff have been excellent greeting us with smiles, saying hello, and assisting with whatever we needed.. Staff is wonderful!. It is a new normal in most of the hotels post pandemic, so please do not anticipate the cleaning service if you did not ask for it.. We rented a car at the airport, so we used the parking/valet services.. This is, by far, the worst service and accommodations that we have ever experienced during our trips to South beach.. 8.Antagonistic and unfriendly service in pool area.. Unfriendly staff at pool, bar, restaurant and front desk.. So they‚Äôre staff are also thieves.. When I reported this to the front desk I encountered the most unprofessional staff I have ever met .. The staff are pleasant and helpful.. While the hotel is older, the staff keep it clean and well maintained, and the signature scent is welcoming.. The Valet staff are also wonderful!. We then tried to get back downstairs but had to wait a full 15 minutes to get into an elevator - three times it arrived with staff and trolleys who never let guests in instead and let us wait.. We told the front desk and quite frankly they couldn't have cared less.. Shame as it looks lovely and has great facilities, but with staff who clearly couldn't care about their guests, why would you ever want to return?. Friendly staff.. The tap dripped daily and was so loud and the shower wouldn‚Äôt work but the staff didn‚Äôt seem to care.. The customer service at this hotel is extremely poor, it feels like the staff are doing you a favour when you request anything.. I celebrated my special birthday in miami and at every hotel I‚Äôve stayed in on my birthday you would receive a complimentary drink or cake, the reception staff rudely told me they don‚Äôt do anything for birthdays and to go across the road and buy a cake.. The staff here really don‚Äôt care about  customer service and are only nice when they swipe your credit card on arrival.. The worst customer service and horrible bathroom I‚Äôve ever seen.. The bar downstairs where we went to ‚Äúdinner‚Ä?was a disaster.. the man there didn‚Äôt have any interest or intention of do his work‚Ä?useless and rude‚Ä?I‚Äôd like to know the opinion of the manager in case he cares.. When I suggested to the bar staff member that he should ask his manager to get some of the basic F&B  issues sorted he simply shrugged and said ‚Ä?the management doesn‚Äôt listen to any suggestions ‚Ä?. He seriously couldn‚Äôt care less about the customer ‚Ä¶I asked him if this was a four star hotel ?‚Ä?. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever written a review of any establishment I‚Äôve stayed in but I am so annoyed at having to pay over $300 for a room with such sub standard facilities and poor service I felt I should let others know about this place .. I‚Äôm sure there are good staff working at the hotel but seriously , the manager of the hotel needs ti wake up and do his job !. They, and the rest of the staff were always available.. Ashley at the outside bar made my experience so rememberable  she had incredible service skills and no one makes margaritas like her!!. Love the hotel and Petrus on the beach was so helpful ever day making sure we were taken care of with whatever we needed.. The pool staff and beach staff 5 stars!!!!!. Very friendly staff and bartenders.. I‚Äôve been to this hotel several times already for events organized by someone who has chosen this place over and over again because their grandmother used to frequent the Shelborne and it‚Äôs hard to argue it but the service has been terrible every time.. Last but not least, the STAFF.. At check in we had a staff member just walk away without finishing the process.. The coffee counter staff can‚Äôt be bothered, they will blatantly roll their eyes at you because you asked for coffee in a cup.. The pool staff ignores you while they chat with coworkers.. I visited the shelborne with my husband we originally were going to stay for four days extended to a week and a half because the service by Ashley from the pool bar was absolutely amazing i‚Äôve never had service like this before and we travel all the time she was super fun kept the drinks coming great recommendations she‚Äôs a party on her own!!. And the lovely lady at the bell hop is so helpful and kind.. This has to be the worst hospitality I have ever experienced.. To begin, the hotel has a nighttime supervisor named Andrea that has no experience, no hospitality training, and attitude towards guests.. The location is so convenient and the staff is always looking to help.. Also the manager Ibrahim did not care AT ALL about my concerns or even let me speak and yelled at me while we were upstairs in my room making me super uncomfortable.. Excellent customer service.. Overall, the reception staff were very poor and unhelpful and need service skills training.. Despite the Shelborne being recommended to us I would not recommend until a number of failings in staff training and maintenance/cleaning of rooms is addressed.. Coffee at restaurant $6.78‚Ä?. very unfriendly and unaccommodating staff.. For the price you can stay somewhere better and have better service.. ****EDIT *****
Like I promised Elisa ‚Ä?unfortunately this edit is NOT in their favor‚Ä?JACUZZI WAS REPAIRED AGAIN‚Ä?DID HEAT UP ALITTLE‚Ä?other aspects of customer service lacking‚Ä?. Like I said, for the hotel price point go somewhere else‚Ä?I am sorry I am not that picky‚Ä?.

****** BY the way the ONLY workers that deserve a compliment are OMAR( great service recovery)  And Demitrel , very hard worker, very accommodating and a hustler!. I recently stayed at a hotel and had a fantastic experience thanks to the helpful and attentive management team and staff.. Delisa in particular stood out for their exceptional service.. From the valet to the front desk to the wait staff at breakfast and pool to the housekeeping personnel, everyone makes it their mission to make your stay as successful as possible.. The staff and cleanliness are always exceptional and it is a great location in terms of accessibility to everything in Miami Beach.. From a customer service standpoint you won‚Äôt find a better hotel in Miami Beach!. Thanks again Dellisa & Ahmed and the entire staff at the Shelborne for always delivering high quality service.. We had a large party with several questions and needs but Delisa took care of everything.. She was respectful, professional, courteous, and eager to make sure we were all taken care of.. I am in awe on how professional, helpful and kind she was to all of us.. I will 100% recommend this hotel to others who enjoy great customer service and hospitality.. She took care of me, my wife and family.. I must say we were incredibly thankful to the front desk staff Delisa.. Every hotel should have a warm and super helpful staff like this!. Quality customer service is an understatement for how awesome Delisa was to us.. Great customer service does matter!. Simply said it was service with a smile.. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is wonderful.. He is so friendly and helpful as well as the entire staff.. I didn‚Äôt like the cleaning service at all, but it was compensated with the attention we received from the guys working at the beach and the incredible sunrise I had from my room.. We really appreciate the way the staff treated us during our holidays. For more information, visit https://www.shelborne.com/ or check reviews online to learn more about guest experiences."

Staff was very personable and accommodating!. Staff helpful and friendly.. Staff were friendly and responsive.. Also, the staff are amazing and so helpful.. There were three staff members this most recent stay who were warm, caring, helpful and willing to go out of their way.. The staff is so welcoming and gracious as well in even allowing guests who have checked out to return and use the lobby and restrooms for changing.. Software very clunky after 4 hours of help from their customer service agent I managed to get it uploaded.. 1 month later I am emailed this morning to tell me that I have to download biometrics again,  Customer service dept advised that they had fallen off their system.. Couldn‚Äôt be bothered with the grief of potential issues so have cancelled booking and made a reservation with a slightly more expensive hotel with a traditional booking system,  feedback to the Sonder, your customer service staff are first rate,  the booking process leaves a lot to be desired.. The Abbey was very nice and the staff went out of their way to get me ice and bring it to my room without me asking for it!. Great location, very clean, very good service.. Helpful staff, clean and well designed rooms, ease of use through the app, and an unbeatable location for walking anywhere you need to be.. There hospitality is awesome.. Perfect location
Lovely staff
Beautiful room
10/10 would recommend!. we couldn‚Äôt have been happier with how the hotel and staff were!. The staff was very polite and well intended..

Key highlights from guest reviews include: This is our first review  - taking the time because as a former waitress through college, ( nowadays ""servers"" ), we seldom see this level of service.. We had a room no balcony, supposedly Seaview but the palm trees block this, we enjoyed walking along the boardwalk and meeting other people.. And the keys, especially the Key Largo and the Caribbean bar, drinks for 5 dollars, beautiful view and really nice people.. Every morning at 7:30, I joined the rooftop yoga class, with its beautiful views of the sun rising, followed by a coffee at the Starbucks across the street and a walk on the beach!. It was nicely decorated with green leafy wallpaper, cute, comfortable beds, and a sitting area, but the view left something to be desired. Amazing hospitality from the start.. You will Get taking care of.. Personell is amazing and very helpful in every situation.. The only minus is That i think its overpriced for the room of such quality but overall the staff did amazing job, food is great so i recommend highly The Betsy Hotel for Miami vibe experience. Very helpful staff and thanks to Fritzner and Akhona on reception for great service.. This is our first review  - taking the time because as a former waitress through college, ( nowadays ""servers"" ), we seldom see this level of service.. Most of the staff have been there 5+ years and that makes a valuable difference

At lunch, no charge hot popovers are the bread basket.. From the staff to the food we found the place top notch.. Lovely staff, especially the front desk team (Akhona, Fritz).. Service, food/bev, rooms, pool, we can't say enough.. Art work, books, and excellent service (call out to Evens who was super helpful).. After few days you feel well with an attentive and professional staff.. Excellent service from the front desk and Hendrik when we extended our stay and needed later checkout due to personal circumstances.. Great place staff super friendly loved Fritz and Jackie who always greeted us with a smile.. Two private pools, excellent service and good food options 
A classic location and hotel with a staff that works hard and friendly to accommodate guests. We met a number of lovely, talented, and knowledgeable staff at The Betsy!. Staff are amazing, especially in the restaurant and the guys on the door/assising with luggage (as the road out front is closed).. Jackie and Hendrick on the front desk couldn't be more helpful.. Easily the classiest hotel on Ocean Dr, amazing setting, courteous staff, fantastic breakfasts on the terrace, cocktails can't be faulted (although horrifically expensive), nice pool area (quite exposed when the wind gets up) and spotlessly clean.. The staff are friendly and tea and coffee in room was a bonus.. Great service, check in, room, dining, evening jazz, wonderful front desk.. Special shout out to Jackie at the front desk for excellent service.. The Staff was so friendly.. Also a big thank you to 
Jonathan Plutzik who is always interesting and helpful.. Excellent service between the front desk, concierge, and bar/restaurant.. Enjoyed rooftop pool with bar service.. Every member of the Betsy South Beach staff went above and beyond to ensure our stay was fantastic!. Juan, Art Barraza (Concierge), Paul Drecq (Concierge), Esra and Fritzner at the Front Desk especially provided us with such exceptional customer service throughout our stay for which we were most appreciative!. Staff are friendly when engaged but they are generally busy.. Nor was the level of service at this price point.. Classy gem of a hotel in South Beach Miami with direct beach access, amazing amenities and wonderful service & staff.. We return every year to this elegant hotel with the friendliest, most amazing staff.. Their attention to service and to their guests is truly wonderful!. Staff was really nice and the rooftop pool was great!. All the staff we met were friendly, approachable and helpful but a special mention to Ezra on the front desk, and the two superb concierges Art & Paul.. I would especially like to mention the hotel staff.. I travel a lot with my boyfriend and we have not yet met such courteous service anywhere.. Top notch- live music, the staff, at least 3 grand pianos and live music every evening during our stay.. The location, restaurant, rooms, staff, etc.. Service was impeccable.. Service and staff were above and beyond.. ), and friendly hotel staff, who greeted us with champagne and beverages for our children.. The pool was well staffed, had a great menu and a nice vibe‚Ä?great play list, which ties in with the nostalgic rock n‚Ä?roll photos that grace the hotel walls.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: My husband was disappointed that we didn't have a balcony or ocean view  (no upgrades happened to be available at check-in for Hyatt Globalists), BUT I didn't mind it with the skyline in the distance and pretty sunsets!. The view from our room was amazing.. The rooms are clean and have nice ocean views.. My room was a 2 queen bed with partial ocean view balcony. Facilities, service and room were three star quality at best.. Checked in at 4pm, only to find out pool and beach services end at 5pm.. Bar and restaurant service staff were indifferent.. He has taken care of me with setting up the cabana or bringing my lounge to the perfect spot.. The staff was very friendly.. Staff from the pool to the bar to the restaurant to the lobby were all very friendly, helpful and they work extremely hard.. The hotel in general is run down and in need of a major rehabilitation, the majority of the staff encounters were less than pleasant, the rooms were small and the walls were paper thin (next door unit had a person up all night coughing and throwing up).. We reserved a cabana at the pool and the service was tops.. Our server G took great care of us.. We experienced great service with Khan on the beach and the lounge.. He was so friendly and helpful.. We stayed for 5 nights and even had great service during a rainstorm.. If you have an appreciation for history and classical elegance, this is your spot
Service was great across the board.. It rained almost the whole time but we still enjoyed ourselves with our fantastic food and beverage service from Smart!. Option of beach or pool- it was busy so the pool was packed, the staff on beach got us chairs and umbrella!. Staff was very helpful and friendly also!.

The Fritz Hotel,"The Fritz Hotel is a hotel rated 4.5 stars, located at 524 Ocean Dr, Miami Beach, FL 33139-6616. This hotel offers a range from $168 - $293 per night and is ranked #56 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 22 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: The rooms had bad views and I had to keep the drapes closed the whole time, or neighbors could stare in ... but who cares because the beach was literally across the street!. Although the pool is small the views of the ocean are great ... and there would be a lot of space to relax.. We had high hopes but were terribly misled by the glowing reviews.. I simply can't reconcile those reviews with our unfortunate experience.. We booked an Ocean View Suite with 1 bedroom and kitchen and looked forward to our winter getaway vacation.. If you want more details, you can view photos or read extended comments further below.. I like the views and the pool area that they have here.. This place was so nice just make sure you try to book a full ocean view.. I had a one bedroom with a partial view. The staff is great here.. The rooms had bad views and I had to keep the drapes closed the whole time, or neighbors could stare in ... but who cares because the beach was literally across the street!. Nice staff, great rooms and we walked everything.. Stayed for 3 nights and were very impressed with the room and the staff.. The Argentinian guy on reception (assistant manager) was particularly friendly and helpful.. It is painfully obvious that ownership has set up their staff to fail, leaving them with no resources, inadequate amenities, and not nearly enough staff.. There was a single employee on staff from 5pm until the next morning.. She really tried to help, but was obviously overwhelmed, under-supplied, under-trained, unsupported and simply unable to provide even basic customer service.. I do wish him well and hope that ownership supplies him with adequate staff and resources to make the hotel more successful in the future.. We booked to stay here in April 2022 but had to cancel the booking in January and should have received a refund of our $500 deposit but to date and after many emails and phone calls I have yet to receive a refund - be very careful!. In fact, service from the hotel staff in general was very good.. Great location, very clean, staff is always eager to help you.. The staff here is very friendly and accommodating to make sure that you have everything that you need.. Manny is not nice neither is his staff they all threatened to cancel our stay.. The manager Manu was very friendly and helpful, he let me do a late check out which was great and contributed to a great hotel experience.. I didnt but the guy at the front desk was so helpful and discounted my stay because of this.

The amenities were fantastic, scenery was beautiful and the staff was great.. Their was a women named Joscelyn (I  believe thats her name) at the front desk who was incredibly nice and helpful.. If I could rate this hotel higher than a 5 I definitely would off of customer service alone.. I loveeeeeee the decor, Clarke was super cool and helpful from the moment that I walked in.. My friend was particularly worried because she recently had ACL surgery and one of the hotel staff members, German, exceeded our expectations and went above and beyond to make her feel comfortable and accommodated.. All the staff are simply the best!. Had a great time at the hotel, location was amazing and the staff were so friendly - specially Melina, Aure,Joselyn and joseline from the front desk..

Great Hotel d√©cor and service was excellent, the lady at check in (i didn't catch her name)  was very very helpful and informative..

Key highlights from guest reviews include: This was probably the straw that broke the camels back because we didn‚Äôt have one peaceful night and fear for our lives that if we complained these women would try to fight with us (I‚Äôll get back to this later in this review) Why should we as guest have to be afraid to speak up to others who are being totally inappropriate?. She told me that she talked to the owner and her said they can‚Äôt refund me because I was asking for most of my money back (I was morning 3 and the first two early mornings were horrible of course I want my money back) she then again asked me if I wanted to move to the back of the hotel where it‚Äôs more quiet (no thank you) and was offering that so that I don‚Äôt offer a bad review.. If you have read this far, look up this place (the Julia hotel) and you‚Äôll see in other platforms they have really bad reviews.. You do not get a view from any of them but few places offer a view anyway. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.. Once again thank you to the Julian hotel staff.. This is not okay and honestly the worst experience I‚Äôve had in my life staying somewhere that includes the staff AND hotel owner.. They said they were afraid to ask people to stop yelling and banging because they were scared that based on their tonality and actions this will only make it worst.. Flaunting to his staff how he‚Äôs a millionaire and that they are only working until 3 so there shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.. My wife sure did as well and they did not care.. I have never done this but due to the current events from staff and owner I wish to leave and get as much as I can back from such a horrible stay.. The staff are around.. OST if the day and very friendly and helpful.. Niccolo and his team had exceptional hospitality from beginning to the end.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: We also requested a room with an ocean view that we didn't receive.. The bedroom balcony had the partial ocean view.. Be aware that due to the building across the street, you will only ever have a partial view.. Had a family room with partial view of the Ocean.. Believe everything you read from other reviews about the room, the location and the staff.. Other reviews may have mentioned the coffee, which is Julius Meinl.. Loved sitting on small deck having coffee with view of the ocean.. I had an awful experience at this hotel and I want to invite you to read this review in order for you to make an informed decision on where to stay. Close To the beach, other food options

Was early and was able to leave our bags before our room Was available, headed to the beach and relaxed before actual check in 
Service was lovely and really
Enjoy the food. Great little place with very good food and great service.. Firstly, they have removed the reception desk and getting service proved challenging.. The cleaning service was really poor.. We came back to our room around 4pm and our rooms had not been serviced.. Strange, really given that there were three cleaning staff loitering in the corridor having a chat!!!. Great cocktails and impeccable service.. The staff were friendly and attentive and always went above and beyond to make sure I had everything I needed.. This is not a full-service hotel.. Staff is not present at night.. In our case this unfortunately meant there was a guy bleeding in the lobby and cops and EMS workers everywhere and no staff to help guests understanding what was happening.. There was also confusion between the kitchen and ""hotel"" part of the operation; although Local House materials say there's room service available, this turned out not to be the case for us.. Excellent customer service. The staff was professional, very friendly and kind of like a family running the place.. Location is great and close to the beach, small and cosy hotel with nice staff.. The staff in the hotel side and the restaurant were all very nice.. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating.. We arrived VERY late, but a member of staff sleepily appeared (presumably from her home!). Maids were friendly and helpful.. It is a restaurant/bar with rooms rather than a hotel, so don't expect room service or constant concierge.. But the restaurant is great, very nice for breakfast (very popular), with excellent service.. They have a dry bar that is not staffed, so you have to go downstairs to get drinks poolside.. It would make more sense to fill it with more lounge chairs, get rid of the bar, and extend room service to the pool.. Hotel was clean and staff was wonderful and friendly.. Service is also excellent but can be slow.. Believe everything you read from other reviews about the room, the location and the staff.. Restaurant food is really good and service is super as well.. Great service. By staffing onsite management with inexperienced persons they end up without a professionally run hotel.. That learning curve has not gone beyond the opening chapters of the ""Hospitality 101"" text book.. At a small boutique hotel that wishes to pride itself on its ""family"" like vibe, that is unnerving, and a staffing mistake.. NOTE: this is a clause all guests should be very careful with)   

Satisfactory accountability on their part was stated, but actions demonstrated it was lip service only.. The hotel was trendy and well maintained and all staff we encountered were friendly and nice.. Thanks to the staff at the hotel for making it a memorable trip for us even though it was a short one since the cruise line cancelled our trip without notifying us.. All of the staff was super friendly and helpful.. The oysters, the mussels, the skirt steak the service: all tops.. The ambiance the location the cleanliness the food I can go on and on but most importantly the staff !!!. I have never met such amazing hospitality with all of  the staff in this amazing hotel !!!. Thank you to Macarena, Celine, Victoria and Gonzale.. Friendly staff.. Friendly staff and a free drink to boot.. Wonderful  stay at hotel
The staff was extremely friendly and helpful 
The breakfast was included with stay and was consistently delicious and plentiful 
Always felt safe in the quiet area of south beach.. The staff were the nicest and kindest hotel staff I've ever encountered.. Selen was the most wonderful hostess to us upon arrival and every time she seen us in the hotel, as for the rest of the staff.. Hotel staff was ample and very nice and helpful in whatever we asked.. I booked because they were in Miami Beach, nice location and nice facilities, BUT the service was terrible, they want to charge you extra fees and extra everything and it appears to be that their only purpose is not serving, but charging the guests for everything and anything.. Having been in more than 33 countries and having booked dozens of hotels in my life, this is the first time I encounter such a bad and vicious service.. ThEY DON'T CARE.. Simply terrible service from this hotel.. They also don't seem to care about you, the perception I recieved was that they only want to charge the money for the room plus every possible fee they make up!. They simply don't know or care about costumer service.. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT GIVING GOOD SERVICE.. Especially if you truly care about your image and want to offer the costumer a good experience.. Excellent service!. Great location and friendly staff.. It was difficult to get towels and wash cloths replenished but staff accommodated as soon as we asked.. Restaurant is very good, but beware, most restaurants in South beach, the gratuity is automatically added to the bill, so be careful not to double tip unless the service warrants.

This hotel offers a range from $230 - $363 per night and is ranked #36 of 235 hotels in Miami Beach in Miami Beach. Among its amenities are standard amenities. It has a total of 33 rooms. Key highlights from guest reviews include: The room was on level 2 and we were in 109 which had a cleaners cupboard one side and a linen cupboard the other and they could be noisy at 7am and was on the right hand side on the hotel viewed from Collins and the next door building was close so no view and was dark as a lot of South Beach hotels are and the view we had was untidy, old bed headboards, old chairs, ladders and old debris from the palms.. The breakfast was good and had a good selection which was in the restaurant which in the evening is used by Osteria del Teatro see our separate review.. A week prior I cancelled it and booked The Marlin given the reviews and ranking.. Breakfast is also great compared to the other hotels in the area (I read many reviews for other hotels).. The room was very nice and immaculate, except the view of the dirty back alley.. The view was an ugly building wall less than 20 ft apart from the room windows. Wonderfull and very helpful staff.. Staff is professional.. Host staff knows you by name and has a variety of beach items you can take to the beach.. Everyone was helpful and kind.. The rooms were absolutely stunning everything was super clean, the best part of the entire experience was the customer service received from the front desk never in all of my life have I felt so taken care of it was an absolute pleasure staying here and I would recommend this again to anyone coming to Miami.. the staff is extremely funny and charming and all around amazing.. Staff was excellent, so knowledgeable about the background of the hotel, inviting, and accommodating- especially David, Nana, and the female bartender in the evenings.. A+ customer service!. The staff was collaborative and useful.. The room was spotless and very well maintained and a good size, staff were very friendly and helpful.. Hotel is in a great location just a block back from ocean drive
The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful giving us great recommendations 
The hotel was impeccably clean housekeeping was exceptional 
It was our second visit and can‚Äôt wait to go back. Great staff.. We just so grateful to her and the other staff for making our stay stress free and joyful.. Great reception staff, quiet rooms at night, beach towels and chairs supplied, valet parking for $35 per night, perfect location, comfortable bedding and amazing soft robes to use.. The staff is very friendly and helpful, so even the broken heater was quickly repaired, as we had to bridge the three-day cold snap with 10-15 degrees.. There is no free parking, but the hotel offers a valet parking service, which in Miami beach is alwasys a plus.. Front desk people are very kind and helpful.. The employees are careful and I only have compliments.. Its not the best for sound proofing

Cons
- the service is underwhelming at best.. a very low energy vibe - lacking hospitality and engagement.. Especially the two ladies overseeing the breakfast service (perhaps less engaged on a personal cell phone will on the job might help - especially when there are empty tables that need to be cleared).. The service we experienced at breakfast didn't encourage us to have dinner at the restaurant - we went elsewhere.. We came down at 9:30 and barely anything left - they replenished very slowly (a reflection of the lack of attentiveness by the staff).. - the lobby reception staff just sit there - not once did i see them get up and assist guests.. ... after we got everything out - how helpful.. Good hospitality would've been to get up and take initiative to help with our bags without asking us.. The customer service was great at this hotel.. Excellent and friendly staff.. I appreciate all the kindness and helpfulness of the staff.. Friendly and helpful staff; Marcel, Nana, and Paula were amazing and so helpful with every need or questions we had!. From our arrival the staff were excellent and extremely accommodating as we arrived off a cruise early.. The front desk personnel were professional, but could have been a little more pleasant and helpful.. The service was good.. Pricing was reasonable compared to the service.. Nice and clean hotel with friendly staff.. Nana is very helpful with all questions you may have.. Great customer service.. She was very accommodating and helpful!. Location is great but service and amenities were awful.. The building entrance has stairs (without access ramp), and staff did not help at all, they observed while we struggle in and out with our baby stroller and luggage.. Love her she was so helpful and so accomodating.. Super Great staff.. Very welcoming people and helpful!. The staff was great, especially Marcel.. Marcel was friendly and helpful!

It's a very run down place,  Had to go across the street for drinks and balcony views,  It was clean, but certainly not worth the $450 a night we paid. Leyla, Aleisha, and the wonderful gentleman whose name I wasn‚Äôt able to grab - thank you for your hospitality!. The hotel reception staff are very helpful and welcoming.. Luis was so helpful,  every time we saw him he was smiling!. The hotel is clean and beautiful and the staff are very friendly and helpful.. Special shoutouts to Aleisha, Luis, and Chris for being incredibly kind, helpful, and friendly.. The staff made our stay that much more enjoyable.. And be careful... they will charge you hundreds of dollars on your credit card  if ""you are not present for the day"" in the middleof the stay.. They blame the travel company for a charge mistake that obviously the hotel staff made.. The front desk staff night shirt upon arrival was unfriendly and assured us we had a quiet room!. The only bright spot was a very nice day staff that tried to do what they could to make up for it all.. Friendly and helpful staff.. Aleisha at the front desk was great and helpful and professional with taking care of all our needs and questions.. However, the staff was friendly and the rooms were nice and clean.. All the reception staff are excellent, especially Luis.. Hopefully this has been helpful  UK visitor, January 2023, age 65.. This hotel has a good location, nice lobby bakery and cafe, and helpful and friendly staff.. It is a pity because this is a nice hotel and the staff does its best....

Other than that this property and staff is wonderful.. Thank you Luis and staff for being accommodating and friendly.

a special thanks to Moisis in reception and Emilio at the tiky bar by the pool, you are special people. Our ocean view room was lovely.. Beautiful oceanview from 7th floor window, 3.. The private beach access was great and the rooms were clean and I had an amazing view of the city of Miami.. The room and view was wonderful. The breakfast service was very nice, I would add a coffee choice to it.The cook that is doing eggs your way is an amazing person, chatting to him in the morning and watching him doing all sorts of omelets was very nice.. The room was clean and well maintained (comfy beds, adjustable air), the garden/grounds were absolutely beautiful (love all the orchids and flowering plants), the food was excellent (not a big selection but all was wonderfully cooked), and the staff was just so warm and kind while being amazing at their jobs.. The staff from the front valet through to the beach were all very kind and welcoming.. Everyone took added measures to make us feel on vacation and well taken care of.. The entire property is beautiful and well maintained but the care from some key staff really made for a special trip.. Beach access within steps and service to set up chairs and umbrellas included in resort fee.. The only two minor negatives was there was only one working elevator the entire 4 days which made getting to and from room a very slow process and our room had not been serviced after the first evening.. Nice and cozy clean hotel, friendly staff, great location.. Otherwise great staff, cleanliness, location and ambience. I enjoyed the staff and the stay, very nice.. Dinner and breakfast was great food and service from waiter was right on, Everyone was nice, clean and organized.

the service is excellent, the rooms comfortable, cool and with an incredible view of miami
a special thanks to Moisis in reception and Emilio at the tiky bar by the pool, you are special people. Staff in all areas ( bar, restaurant,pool, beach, reservations) were attentive and went the extra mile to assist in a friendly manner.. All the staff were so friendly and helpful, they made our trip.. Honestly the rudest staff (minus the bar staff out at the Tiki bar) we have ever encountered.. The staff is amazing, friendly, and professional.. Very friendly staff that attended to our needs.The pool is clean, perfect temperature and the pool staff are there to get your chairs set up, put your towels on the chairs, get your drinks, and basically wait on you.. Wonderful staff- the friendliest we have ever encountered.. I will start by saying the support staff are all wonderful and the hotel grounds provide a lovely tropical atmosphere....but the following is what I wish I knew before we made reservations at The Palms.. Fantastic surroundings, Immaculate grounds, Top Tier Staff and Service.. Laid back and personalized service created paradise in a city of fast paced, frenetic vibes.. Having beverage and food service on the beach was very nice as well.. Hotel is very clean and staff is very courteous withONE EXCEPTION THE STAFF RECEPTIONIST IN THE SPA AREA IS VERY RUDE AND JUDGEMENTAL .She ask me that they only accept credit cards and no cash when she did not ask everybody same question .I do believe because I‚Äôm Asian that I cannot afford to stay there.. Staff was nice and friendly and they served good food.. The nail tech was experienced, but rough with nail care, so it was uncomfortable.. The staff is incredible and the grounds are beautiful.. Staff friendly and helpful, 5.. We were out all day and cleaning service said they could not get to our room, 3.. Room service quality is questionable.. The staff were so incredibly kind and helpful.. Extremely professional, courteous staff who were always accessible and eager to assist with everything.. The food and staff were wonderful.. My only issue was with the beach staff not giving out towels or cushions until after 9am.. As an added bonus there were a few iguanas by the pool, and a falconer brought a falcon to breakfast one morning (on a leash) to scare away the other birds.. The food and drinks were all good and service was excellent.. Nice staff.. But staff was very nice.. The staff make it so easy for guests to have a wonderful stay.. Great hotel, great staff!.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: I'd like to give a 4.5 star review because the issues I have with the hotel are out of its control, but I can't give it a 5 so a 4 it is.. Definitely need to get at least a partial ocean view to truly appreciate.. Our stay at the Ritz was overall a great experience, but I wanted to come here to leave a review specifically to give some shout-outs to the staff.. Jefferey helped us get a daybed with an amazing view.He was very nice and gave us a good deal.. We carefully pored over hotel reviews (e.g.. I was happy to have been upgraded to a lanai pool view room.. We booked an extended room double queens with an ocean view and a rollaway. The hospitality is amazing and the beach service here is also incredible.. I was absolutely blown away with the service here on the beach.. From start to finish we were all blown away with the service.. The staff was great and loved the service.. The lady at the front desk was helpful.. And the bellman was helpful to.. Came to the beach today and Jacque was very helpful.. Always made sure he checked up on me with good customer service.. The room was pristine and gorgeous; the cleaning was meticulous, and our children enjoyed the chocolate with turn down service (the maids were super sweet to the kids - they work extremely hard).. Beachside service was outstanding as well.. Outstanding service!. Valet, front desk, concierge, restaurant staff, housekeeping - all were GREAT!. The spa services and facilities were the best and the massages therapists are great and they know all the techniques.. Short staff on weekdays, only 2 of 3 elevators worked.. The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed and ensured we enjoyed our Spring Break getaway.. The pool staff is unmatched...special shout out to Kelly, Yoni, Bryan, Jennifer, Tito, and Cole' for the amazing service.. The service is above and beyond and the hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of all that SoBe has to offer.. The pros - (1) great location, right on beach walk, right in center of great restaurants and nightlife, (2) great pool area, excellent staff working it, excellent food and drink poolside (tuna poke bowl and shrimp aguachile real winners), (3) very comfortable room.. I hate being in a skyscraper on a beach vacation, I liked being able to use stairs or just short elevator to get to pool area, Also bed insanely comfortable, felt too soft at first, but I fell asleep instantly and woke up refreshed (4) all staff we encountered from valets to front desk to bar staff to pool staff and housekeeping were excellent.. The hotel is very pretty and the staff could not be more accommodating but unfortunately I chose this hotel because it did not have any electronic music events during Miami music but unfortunately right next door to the Ritz is the sagamore hotel which has loud music pool parties everyday this week so I'm paying to be at the Ritz but cannot enjoy the pool or my balcony from 1:00 p.m. to midnight.. More about my experience I loved coming to The Ritz- Carlton being nicely greeted by Sonny and serviced by the Amazing Mark.. We‚Äôre so grateful to our favorite new friends Yoni, Emmanuel, William, and Eugene who provide incredible service outside at the pool.. We‚Äôve been outside everyday, and they are always so friendly & helpful with chairs, towels, umbrellas, food & drink, and wonderful conversation.. This is our second timing staying here in 6 months, and we came back for one reason The customer service is just truly out of this world.. I‚Äôve never had service like this before in all my years of staying at luxury hotels.. They truly took care of our every need and even anticipated things we might need before we did.. Truly the best service.. The rooms, pool and bar is, obviously, stunning, but the real standout here is the staff!. If you are looking for a place to stay where
the staff goes above and beyond, this is the place to come!. Staff incredibly friendly and helpful.. Have been here just one day and already amazed at the hospitality.. I‚Äôm mostly amazed at the hospitality.. Our stay at the Ritz was overall a great experience, but I wanted to come here to leave a review specifically to give some shout-outs to the staff.. The entire staff of the hotel was highly hospitable.. However, the wait staff at the beach really stood out.. Their service was efficient and punctual, and they made us feel so pampered and relaxed.. The Ritz must have excellent training for their staff, but I think they must also just know how to pick good, solid people to work there :) thank you all for everything!. I call them the dynamic duo because of their outstanding service and friendly nature.. Jean and Jeffrey were amazing staff members who tended to our every need!. Jacque took great care of us and made sure we were all set for our beach day.. To customer service and service.. Staff is amazing!!!!. While the staff was great at the beach, I definitely will not be coming back.. Very friendly  staff ,beautiful  atmosphere, great location,stay here if you want to be treated  like royalty.. I would  like to thank the staff again they were fantastic.. The staff were so incredible and hospitable - they make sure you are having a great time and make your trip memorable!. Breon and jacque‚Äôs customer service was exceptional, along with jeff and daryl.. Food, drinks, service and atmosphere where a 10/10.. Jacque, Breon, Jeff and Daryl took great care of us.. I have to say shout to the beach manager Jefferey he was very helpful and so nice on helping out with a daybed for my birthday.. Beach was stunning the beach attendants and managers were so helpful.. The hotel was not impressive.. the beach staff is what made it an amazing experience.. Our server Mark was so accommodating and very catering to our needs during our vacation which made the trip wounded full!!. The customer service is everything to me and that‚Äôs exactly what he delivered!. From the moment we arrived the entire staff took immaculate care of us.. Very responsive staff.. He was very helpful and attentive.. From check-in to the beach,  to the restaurant and the pool, to the way our room was kept, the service at the Ritz South Beach was impeccable.. Jacque was very helpful on the beach.. From the staff service to the ambiance of the property, the South Beach Ritz is one of the best hotels I've ever experienced.. They go above and beyond with their service; I wish all hotels could have this level of care for their guests.. The pool staff especially will leave a great impression.. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better day.The service takes this hotel to the next level.. Though the rooms, shared spaces, pool, beach and amenities are first-rate, the excellent service really takes this hotel to the next level.. We carefully pored over hotel reviews (e.g.. Veronica at the front desk completely changed the course of entire stay with the incredible room she selected and her exceptional service and courtesy.. Attentive staff clear empty cups, etc.. ALL of the staff were great but Alfredo, Jennifer, and Yoni were fantastic.. Also Kelly was very helpful each morning to help us grab some chairs.. Staff comes around a few times a day with complimentary juices or snacks, and everything on the pool menu was delicious.. Same setup on the beach, though‚Äîchairs, umbrellas and staff.. From the service, friendliness, and hospitality was phenomenal.. Ingrid at the pool ,Tito and resort staff is wonderful.. Excellent location, very friendly staff and great ambience.. Three women and Brendan at the desk who claimed to be the highest level mgr on staff said no can do because of fire code.. It was a really disappointing to give up an hour of our vacation fighting with staff.. The hotel is lovely but I wouldn‚Äôt recommended or return if there is risk of this type of service

I want to note we never were rude, we just wanted what was promised and should have been treated by all staff like we were by the second Brandon For more information, visit https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/miami/south-beach or check reviews online to learn more about guest experiences."

Thank you George and your staff for the unforgettable hospitality and experience we will be back!. Very slow service round the pool and food left around uncollected for literally hours, unless you‚Äôre fortunate enough to get the blonde lady poolside, who was exemplary at her job.. To sum up, great hotel, great location, great rooms but seriously lacking from a food, drink and customer care perspective.. We had a group of 19 people and the staff was extremely accommodating in providing all of us with lounge chairs by the pool/beach, and frequently checked in to see if we wanted anything to eat or drink.. I came to the hotel for a day pass ..the front desk agent Denzel was awesome ..he offered us water , And showed us great hospitality ..his energy and spirit was the upmost greatest ..also David made us the best drinks and was so attentive.. Pros: 
Superb service; small hotel so attention to detail; decor and feel is quaint; pool area feels like my backyard and a private garden; walking path that goes for miles directly behind backyard; and right passed that is a deep sand beach with free beach loungers and umbrellas and towels; with full service food/drinks with waiters..

The entire team took care of us and we have a great day .. Top notch service, great food and amazing drinks.. There were a few stand out staff that were great.. David at the desk was very helpful and microwaved our food that we brought back from restaurants.. My friend and I spent every day on the beach and the service was exceptional, especially our server Arwin.. Arwin was fabulous, polite and attentive
Finding this spot with beach rentals & for/drink service was perfection 
Sun, beach, food and cocktails, a dream come true.. Arwin always provides the best service when I am here.. Arwin takes care of us and is attentive to our needs.. The best service in all Miami, I was attended by Arwin, Philip and Jessica, they were super friendly and attentive.. Arwin provided excellent service and made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay.. They have a decent section of the public beach but who cares - literally everyone does on SoBe.. We enjoyed our time at the pool and got amazing service from Kelsey and George!. Kindest staff ever, a great place to go if you‚Äôre looking for a serene place to stay!. This is our second trip there in two years and the service is top notch.. Additionally the staff for the Sandbar restaurant by the pool is fabulous.. The bar staff was friendly and new the menu well.. The pool side service from Lautaro was amazing; in collaboration with his colleagues they assured my mom and I were comfortable.. On top of the excellent service, the package included:

-1 reserved a poolside chaise lounge chair with an umbrella
-1 reserved VIP beach lounge chair with umbrella
-Towel service
-Outdoor showers
-Food and drinks were available for purchase from the Sand Bar.. Yet the most beautiful and impressive asset of this hotel is its amazing staff.. Every staff member I encountered, from the check- in (Rose was splendid with us) to the cleaning staff were adorable and eager to help.. We had a perfect beach day, we got chairs by the pool, the place is clean and not overcrowded, it has a good vibe, great attention to detail and service, our server Lautaro was wonderful!. George & Valentina with the most welcoming and best service we could‚Äôve asked for.. Had a bunch of time to kill before a flight and couldn‚Äôt be happier with the pools, service, and staff!. The Savoy is a good location and friendly service for the price and the rooms are nicely decorated but I wouldn't stay here again because the pool was too cold, the beds weren't very comfortable and the food wasn't great by south beach standards..

Many reviews mentioned complimentary coffee in the lobby, but apparently they do not have this service any more.. Staff were very friendly, and the beach and pool services were good..

Service by hotel staff as A+.. The staff at the beach area was equally attentive.. Service for drinks & food was fairly fast.. Please note:   20% service charge is automatically added to you drink/food bill, but we tipped extra because everyone was great.. Day pass service included lounge chairs , umbrellas, at beach & pools, hammocks, showers etc.. Having drinks at the Sandbar, poolside, I had a great experience meeting George, the manager and his staff of Kelsey and Christos..

Key highlights from guest reviews include: Honest Review: price $300 plus per night
Pro: good location, clean room, front porch good for people watching, nice staff mostly
Cons: small room #107, cable tv went out in the morning, toilet seat broken, maintenance support only available M-F, no shelves in bath room, exhaust fan didn‚Äôt work, thin walls heard people walking around during day & night. From the porch lively view on Collins.. Don't be fooled by the reviews  from 5-7 years ago.. There was a time before March 2020 when I would have given The Shepley Hotel a top review on almost every account.. Did a ton of research for a hotel in south beach and found this place and saw all of the great reviews as well as the great location.. I now understand the raving reviews about the staff - I had a feeling they loved us just for staying there!. I read all the bad reviews before posting. All staff, but especially Gabby and Gus were so friendly and nice!. The hotel facilities were fine, the room was comfortable, the service (especially by Gus) was quite good, the continental breakfast was fine, and the location is just one block away from Ocean Blvd.. Honest Review: price $300 plus per night
Pro: good location, clean room, front porch good for people watching, nice staff mostly
Cons: small room #107, cable tv went out in the morning, toilet seat broken, maintenance support only available M-F, no shelves in bath room, exhaust fan didn‚Äôt work, thin walls heard people walking around during day & night. The hotel decor and service did not disappoint.. Their hard-working, well-groomed and polite young men constantly cleaning the foyer, opening doors, carrying luggage up the stairs and generally being helpful are also an asset to the hotel and made our stay very enjoyable.. We liked that the hotel was staffed 24 hours a day.. It was only 4 days alone on vacation , the staff was amazing and kindly welcomed me.. Excellent location, typical SoBe building, very friendly staff.. The staff at The Shepley really couldn‚Äôt do enough to make our stay memorable and enjoyable.. This area of Miami  doesn't offer a good value for money accomodation facility and all hotels are very expensive considering the service and the quality of buildings and furnitures.. Rooms are small but nice and cleaned, breakfast included is an added value, staff is kind.. The staff were so incredibly friendly and the room was simple and clean.. Checked in early evening and welcomed by helpful staff.. Overall the staff were very helpful and location was great.. The staff were extremely accommodating and could not do
enough for us.. Gabby at the desk took excellent care of us.. Beautiful and clean lovely staff great location 
Nothing was too much trouble, the rooms were spotless and very comfortable with lovely amenities and a great continental breakfast in the morning‚Ä?. The hotel staff were welcoming and made our stay very enjoyable.. Great hotel with a beautiful building, delightful staff and in a great location.. Great hotel Great service. Extremely friendly and helpful staff.. The staff couldn't do enough for us from the minute we arrived and nothing was too much trouble.. Hotel staff were very friendly and always helpful.. Such a quaint hotel with great staff and service.. The hotel staff Gus is inappropriate and does not respect women.. After complaining to Expedia  my intention was to drop the matter and enjoy the rest of  my stay but when I arrived to the hotel after stroll i was approached by Gus the hotel staff with hostility in front of other hotel guest  for complaining to Expedia.. Happy staff, we can‚Äôt wait to see you again.. The staff was friendly and helpful.. The service 10 points, the staff is so gentle.. One block to the beach, with service.. The property is nice and refurbished, the hotel room is beautiful to the eye, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom has products with an exclusive feel, the staff are nice and friendly and will help you carry luggage and open the front door every time you pass.. We were therefore shocked at the next to non-existent safety attitude among the staff of The Shepley Hotel.. First of all, the hotel was severely overstaffed, meaning that it was hard to pass through the common areas and maintain social distance to the employees.. The staff also seemed surprised that we declined to have someone come up close and try to carry our bags (Hello!. The automated disinfection gel at the hotel entrance remained empty throughout the three days we were at the hotel - a symbol of the carelessness.. A lovely hotel with outstanding hospitality!. The staff is superb and incredibly attentive & responsive.. My only suggestion would be to consider a contract with a beach chair service as opposed to the little sand chairs the hotel gives out currently.. Thank you and your staff so much for making our brief getaway so wonderful and  our particular thanks to Gus for the laughs and the extra candy.. The staff is amazing.. Guest services and housekeeping professional and courteous.. The staff at the hotel was very friendly.. The air conditioning unit was extremely noisy - to the point the staff asked for it to be replaced, this however didn‚Äôt make any noticeable difference.. Jorge, Gus and other staffs were very polite and friendly.. When we arrived the man working at the front desk wasn't helpful and kept telling us they had no rooms for us.. He refunded our money and recommended to email him a testimony about what happened and he would forward it to the management company (Alquimia Hospitality Group).. The staff members at the Shepley were super friendly and helpful.. The staff were all so personable and kind.. I now understand the raving reviews about the staff - I had a feeling they loved us just for staying there!. Always friendly and attentive, ready to chat about anything and nothing, prompt to give helpful suggestions.. Here was my experience:

Cleanliness:

Cleaning staff was exceptional.. Staff:

The staff was unbelievably nice and accommodating...and don't forget this is during spring break!. I was usually greeted by two staff members at night and three during the day.. Staff was always friendly and easy to talk to.. I have been to the Oriental hotel in Bangkok, i have stayed at the Shangri-la in Singapore, i have traveled all over this world and i can tell you that the staff was more helpful and friendly than any hotel staff i have encountered.

My husband and I love coming here and the attention is one of the best parts (& the view)!. From the incredible views of the water and atmosphere, to the warm pool and the luxurious spa.. Great breakfast cafe, lunch views and pool.. The spa is very good, pool with a bay view really nice, but our night in the room wasn't so good, we could hear all the sex noises from the party next door, and the upstairs room sound like a flamenco dance pretty much all night.. Literally, we could hear everything from other rooms, not the best sleep experience night at all that's why I can't give it a 5-star review.. It was delicious with a wonderful view.. Incredible and beautiful moments in this hotel with my partner, incredible attention, and the spectacular food, the sauna was one of my favorite parts and the view of the sea during the sunset was a dream, thanks to Sofia for being so fun and taking care of our pet and the rest of the workers for such friendly quality service. Beautiful pool with views of the bay.. This review is specifically for Lori Bell AKA ""The Good Witch"" who works at the The Standard Spa.. She's reviewed my astrological chart and provided readings. We always look forward to having him take care of us.. The spa was AWESOME with highly attentive and accommodating staff.. Charlene‚Äôs customer service skills are impeccable , she made us feel so comfortable.. The service and stuff was just amazing.. The service here is a 10 out of 10!. The service and staff are available and willing to meet any of our needs.. I‚Äôve stayed here for several years and I can honestly say this place has lower and lower service quality.. Front desk staff doesn‚Äôt know how to block out rooms and give you the wrong requests, the pool staff gives your seat away while you are paying to get upgraded, the serving water in the pool continues to have black residue at the bottom of the glass.. Sunshine, great service, many dips in the Bay, ice cold drinks (and water too).. We had one tiny hiccup and two people on Staff reached out to make it right and even better!. The staff are wonderful, knowledgable and always professional.. So grateful for his excellent service.. We loved the service by the pool and felt extra cared for by servers Craig and Peterson.. Diana - Peter have incredibly attentive service at the pool!. Also received great service from Petersen.. Kimona, made me feel so welcome and cared for.. Great drinks and table side service.. Amazing valet service (quick and efficient), shout out to Jorge!. Great great service.Jorge Lastra manager greeted us when we arrived and sent us off after three days feeling so special!. Definitely great personality and perfect service and energy to match what we needed!. Great service.. The whole staff was lovely and service was on point considering how busy it was.. The variety of treatment options and services is impressive.. The staff are completely attentive and helpful.. They get A++ for good service.. No coffee service in the room.. Service at pool was a little bit harsh and slowly, but best smile and attitude was from Diana at pool.. Incredible and beautiful moments in this hotel with my partner, incredible attention, and the spectacular food, the sauna was one of my favorite parts and the view of the sea during the sunset was a dream, thanks to Sofia for being so fun and taking care of our pet and the rest of the workers for such friendly quality service. The staff were great and attentive.. Excellent service, helpful staff, great energy.. Jorge at valet and Jamie doing drink service by the pool were both extremely helpful, professional, and attentive.. You‚Äôre lucky to have such great staff working for you!. She makes me feel safe and cared for.. Well kept with great service.. Nail spa services with Karen are next level!.

Hotel close to shops and restaurants, a few steps from the beach and free deckchairs available at Boucher and Brothers, roof top swimming pool with nice view, however a bit small for the number of people who stay at UMA so never enough space and quality of the rather average water.. I almost never write a review,  even though I travel extensively both domestically and internationally now that I no longer work for a living.. We initially booked a 3 stars hotel that had amazing photos online and great reviews.. My ""sunrise luxury"" room was well appointed, very comfortable and had a nice view of Collins ave at 18st.

Key highlights from guest reviews include: First off we had very high expectations for the W Hotel after reading the reviews.. The gentlemen reviewed his records and told me that when I checked in I never presented my AAA card for the discounted rate I had booked, so instead of being charged $1,450 a night I was just converted to a $2,250 a night charge.. Our room was supposed to be oceanfront, except they failed to mention it was on the 4th floor and in direct view of giant palm trees.. I didn‚Äôt book a pool view room I booked an ocean front..

Great hotel, great staff, I recommend.. the staff that helped us were francisco, jeffery, latoya, and octovio.. they were all very sweet, kind, helpful, and had great service for me and my friends im general.. This was my first time with friends and I‚Äôm truly amazed with the amazing service.. Great customer service.. Octavio was very nice and helpful as well..

The Service is top notch!. They take great care of me when I‚Äôm here!. On our final day (2/23) we finally received some excellent service from the three female servers at the pool area; they were sweet and attentive.. I panicked and immediately went to the service stand where I saw my bag jammed onto a shelf and was told, ""You only have 45 minutes until we give you chairs to other guests"".. The pool and beach service was the absolute worst I have ever encountered.. The food and beverage service takes forever from chairs, forever to find someone to take your order, and forever to receive your order, if at all.. On one of the afternoons we gave up on our guac and drinks ever arriving after and hour and canceled the order, and the beach service was pathetic.. On Tuesday we gave up on the pool chairs and sat at the table at the bar area waiting for service, alerting the girl who sat us several times that we needed a server, after 30 minutes we gave up.. On most days 3/4 elevators were out of service.. So this was how I spent my last morning of my vacation, at your understaffed front desk, begging for my bill to be accurate."". He always takes care of me every time I come!. I can confidently say this hotel is the nicest in terms of amenities, service & ambiance.. The rooms, the pool, the staff all top notch.. Mackenson is an asset and his customer service skills are top notch.. - Food & bev is overpriced and subpar at best
- You could tell that nearly everyone that worked for this property generally didn‚Äôt care about their guests‚Ä?experience.. It's a very nice hotel with clean, spacious rooms, quiet AC and great service.. Very rapid responses, really helpful feedback and very successful in obtaining difficult to get reservations.. I hope our stay will be as good as the pre-stay service from Brad and Sajaa of the W South Beach team.. The front desk staff was fun and lively.. The pool staff was great service.. The W is able to provide outstanding service and they definitely go above and beyond for their guests.. The view was incredible and the service was beyond enjoyable.. The bathroom is great and service just perfect.. It was a great spot to spend the day and the staff will take care of all your needs.
