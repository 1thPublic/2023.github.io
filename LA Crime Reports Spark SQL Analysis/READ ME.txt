This is a LA crime data analysis using Spark SQL on Databricks.

Analyzed 766k+ LA crime data with Databricks SQL (for big data), rating danger level of districts in respects of 
crime type seriousness and deadly weapon usage and safety environment around UCLA, visualized in heatmap.

The project has shown my ability to efficiently deal with big data analysis with appropriate BI tools and the ability
to construct data dashboard for visualization.

Also, it solved my concern a bit for safety living around UCLA when I study there. What a good news!
